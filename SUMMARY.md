['The protein expressed from the IBV S1 protein multi-epitope cassette and the NDV NP protein were found at 35 and 53 kDa bands in P1 and P20 of rNDV-IBV-T/B lysates, however, the parental virus strain LaSota only had the~53 kDa NP protein band (Figure 2) , confirming that rNDV-IBV-T/B successfully expressed the IBV S1 protein multi-epitope cassette in vitro and that the protein was antigenic, as evidenced by its recognition on a Western blot by anti-IBV serum.'
 'To determine whether inserting the IBV S1 protein multi-epitope cassette into the NDV LaSota genome affects the biological properties of the recombinant virus, the growth characteristics and pathogenicity after 20 passages of rNDV-IBV-T/B were evaluated through virus titration, MDT, and ICPI tests in vitro and in vivo.'

 'The HA titers of LaSota and rNDV-IBV-T/B were the same (2 10 ).'
 'The VN antibodies induced by rNDV-IBV-T/B administration could effectively neutralize heterologous IBV strain, indicating that the recombinant vaccine could protect against heterologous IBV challenge.To evaluate the efficacy of the multi-epitope vaccine in protecting against IBV and NDV, one-day-old SPF chicks were immunized with rNDV-IBV-T/B virus or PBS via the oculonasal route.'
 'The protection of chickens vaccinated with the multi-epitope vaccine was significantly higher than that of the PBS and LaSota vaccine groups (p < 0.05).'
 'The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer against NDV and virus neutralization (VN) antibody titer against IBV are expressed as mean log2 ± standard deviation.To evaluate the efficacy of the multi-epitope vaccine in protecting against IBV and NDV, oneday-old SPF chicks were immunized with rNDV-IBV-T/B virus or PBS via the oculonasal route.'
 'The protection of chickens vaccinated with the multi-epitope vaccine was significantly higher than that of the PBS and LaSota vaccine groups (p < 0.05).']

['Only mannosylated E glycoproteins (which are exposed at the surface of DV virions transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes), and not E proteins with complex glycosylation (produced in mammalian cells), have been shown to interact with DC-SIGN-expressing cells (22) .DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are endocytic receptors and their cytoplasmic tails carry putative internalisation signals such as a dileucine (LL) motif (which is present in both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN) and a tri-acidic cluster that is believed to be involved in intracellular trafficking (Fig.'
 'We recommend the two following reviews for an overview of the physiological importance of LSECs in viral infections of the liver (6,7) .In this chapter, we will provide general protocols to study the molecular interactions between viruses and DC-SIGN or L-SIGN and to investigate the functions of these two lectins in viral infection and transmission.'
 'We next present protocols to produce soluble viral envelope proteins using a Semliki forest virus (SFV) vector (35-37) and to study the molecular basis of viral capture and internalization by DC-SIGN or L-SIGN.'
 'Note that only HIV gp120 DMJ , which carries only mannosylated N-glycans, binds to DC-SIGN.Wild-type viruses or viral particles carrying the reporter genes firefly luciferase (Luc) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) can both be used to study DC-SIGN and L-SIGN-mediated cis-infection and trans-enhancement of target cell infection.'
 'DC-SIGN-or L-SIGN-expressing cells and their parental counterpart (10 5 cells) are exposed to viral particles for 2 h at 37°C at varying MOI in FSC-free medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, pH approx 7.5.'
 'Viral transmission is quantified two or 3 d later.DC-SIGN-or L-SIGN-expressing cells and their parental counterpart (10 5 cells) are incubated with viral particles at a low MOI (insufficient to directly infect target cells) for 2 h at 37°C and immediately co-cultured with target cells without washing.'
 'The protocol is similar to that described under Subheading 3.4.2. or 3.4.3. except that co-culture with target cells is started several days after exposure of cells expressing DC-SIGN or L-SIGN to virus.'
 'The advantage of production of viral particles is that cells can be infected at equal MOI and hence the quantity of protein produced is more reproducible than direct electroporation with pSFV-∆env RNA.']

['a welcome opportunity to reflect on the most severe pandemic events of natural origin, particularly as we are approaching the centennial of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic-the most recent global event that fulfills the proposed GCBR definition.'
 'We would like to highlight a few issues that we have pondered over the years while studying historical and contemporary pandemics in relation to perceived pandemic impact and preparedness planning.A measure of geographic spread should be included in the GCBR definition.'
 'In the world of influenza, a pandemic is defined as a novel virus that spreads to at least 2 world regions; and following the unexpectedly mild 2009 pandemic, a measure of clinical severity was added in order to better tailor the strength of interventions.'
 "On the flipside, the 1918 pandemic was associated with a death rate of 1% to 2%, which seems low in comparison to other threats; but given its broad geographic extent, the total death toll amounts to as many as 50 million deaths in today's population, over a few months.Early robust measurement of clinical severity is challenging in an emerging threat scenario."
 'On the other hand, the first pandemic wave in the summer of 1918 was mild, and early measurement would have resulted in substantial underestimation of the serious main pandemic wave that autumn.'
 'Because of the dearth of human population experiences with GCBR-type events in the past hundred years, it is critical to conduct careful studies of historical pandemics, starting with the bubonic plague era, in order to elucidate the transmission patterns and impact of past pandemic events in various settings, populations, and circumstances.'
 'Similarly, the death toll of the 2009 pandemic was low in high-income countries, probably mostly due to intense and costly intensive care treatment of an unusual number of severely ill young adults.In conclusion, we believe there is a need for more studies of past experience with natural pandemics and pandemic threats, in order to elucidate the complex relationship among pathogen, host, and population immunity, as well as environmental conditions that together shape the mortality impact.'
 "But what might happen if the smallpox virus were to reemerge in today's population?The answer is not straightforward, considering on one hand the general susceptibility to this pathogen in those under 50 years of age who were never vaccinated and the increased population size and mobility, and on the other hand, the improved general immune status and better hygiene, suggesting less severe outcomes of infection."]

['In addition, several lines of evidence show the interaction between components of the humoral arm of innate immunity and extracellular matrix elements, hence suggesting new roles of these molecules in the tissue repair process.Here we discuss the roles of cellular and molecular elements of the innate immune system in tissue repair, focusing on the function of the humoral innate immunity and in particular on the long pentraxin PTX3.Wounds heal efficiently through distinct but overlapping phases, hemostasis-inflammation, proliferation and remodeling, which involve specific cell types [4] .'
 'Excessive neutrophil accumulation and persistence at the wound site contribute to altering the tissue repair process through the release of cytotoxic mediators, which cause increased tissue damage and persistent inflammation [8] , as observed in chronic non-healing wounds.Macrophages are involved in the promotion of effective healing through the regulation and resolution of inflammation and induction of ECM deposition [9] .'
 'Regulation, ligands and relevant in vivo functions of PTX3 will be described in detail in following sections.Components of the humoral arm of innate immunity that play a role in tissue damage principally belong to the complement system, which in addition to defense from infections [31] , also regulates migration and activation of immune cells involved in wound healing [32] .'
 'Upon binding to altered host cells in ischemia/reperfusion injury, MBL promotes the activation of the lectin complement pathway contributing to inflammation and hence tissue damage [35, 36] .Studies on the involvement of CRP in tissue damage are complicated by the low level of conservation among species in terms of regulation of expression (CRP is not an acute phase protein in the mouse) and functional activities (e.g.'
 'The in vivo administration of PTX3 rescued all the alterations associated with PTX3-deficiency, including premature wound contraction, altered clotting response and augmented collagen deposition, and the N-terminal domain of PTX3 alone recapitulated the activity of the whole molecule, suggesting therefore the primary involvement of this domain in tissue repair [51] .'
 'Use of confocal and two-photon microscopy, a pH sensitive probe and fluorophore-conjugated specific antibodies ascertained the occurrence of PTX3 interaction with fibrin and Plg preferentially in more acidic areas in the wound site [51] .At the beginning of new tissue formation, remodeling macrophages and MSCs enter the wound allowing the replacement of the provisional matrix by granulation tissue rich in type I collagen, as well as other ECM proteins [4] .'
 'Thus, this study suggests that the fibrinolysis mediated by MSC-derived PTX3 is directly related to the dissolution of clot and remodeling of the fibrin-rich provisional matrix, and is required for the migration of these cells into the wound, which constitutes an important pre-requisite for appropriate wound healing in this model.'
 'These results suggest therefore a potential therapeutic use of PTX3 as modulator of fibrinolysis in abnormal processes of tissue repair, for instance in human pathological hypertrophic scars.In the model of vascular thrombosis, PTX3 limited the thrombotic response, and the N-domain of PTX3 was responsible of attenuation of FG-induced platelets aggregation, whereas the PTX3 C-terminal domain was shown to inhibit collagen-induced platelet activation [70] .']

["It is important to maintain the vigilance with this disease due to the importance of the horses' social network and the high number of movements for international competitions, and to control the disease to avoid its use as a biological weapon (16) .There are other possible routes of entry such as bioterrorism, biological leaks, illegal trade; but not referred to this work for not having access to detailed and concrete data for a quantitative analysis of the risk of introduction of diseases by these pathways.The main objective of this work is to evaluate the risk of entry of animal infectious zoonotic and non-zoonotic diseases from North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula to countries of the European Union by different pathways.Sixteen countries of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula are included in this study (Table 1) The possible routes of entry of each selected disease, based on an extensive literature review, are provided ( Table 2 )."
 "The results are shown in Table 3 .The probability of introduction of the j disease into the European Union through live animal's trade from the country i (PIA i j ) is calculated as the proportion of animals that are annually The formula chosen to estimate the probability that a j disease reaches the European Union coming from the country i through transport-vehicles (PIT i j ) is a ratio between the vehicles or load transported arriving to the European Union from the country i and the total vehicles or load transported to the European Union, multiplied by the probability of the country i being affected by the disease j (PPA j i ) and the probability of the vehicles being contaminated by the pathogen responsible for the disease j.The probability of a vehicle being contaminated is obtained from the average survival of the pathogen in surfaces (PSA j ) and the average disinfection of vehicles (0.1)."
 'In addition, for the countries that had never notified a disease, it has been assigned a zero probability.The probability of introduction of the j disease into the European Union through the importation of animal products from the country i (PIS i j ) is the ratio between the proportion of animal products that are annually transported to the European Union coming from the country i and the total animal products transported to the European Union, multiplied by the probability of the country i being affected by the disease j (PPA The probability of the vector or infective particle remaining viable during the route (PSV j i ) is established with a review of the conditions of rainfall and humidity in the countries of study (Weather History|Weather Underground).'
 'To do this, we calculate the probability of occurrence of the opposite case, the probability of no introduction of the j disease by any of the routes of entry, using the following formula: There is no available information about some diseases in some countries; therefore, no probability has been assigned for those countries.'
 'There is a lower risk of entry of highly pathogenic avian influenza through the movement of live birds from Egypt and Saudi Arabia.In the movement of animal products, the countries representing a higher risk of entry of diseases are Egypt, Mauritania, Niger and Saudi Arabia, the three of them with a higher risk of introduction of foot and mouth disease into the European Union.The probability of entry of infectious diseases through people movement and transport-vehicles is low, but they are the only likely routes of entry of certain diseases such as heartwater, peste des petits ruminants, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).Cowdriosis is a vector-borne disease transmitted by ticks (Amblyoma genus in the majority of cases).'
 'If the North African Coast countries, the countries of the study that show in the simulations a certain probability of particles dispersion arriving to the European Union, remain free of Rift Valley fever, there will be no risk of introduction of this disease.To confirm the absence of risk of introduction of Rift Valley fever through this pathway, the situation of the disease in the countries of the study, which so far are not affected, should be checked periodically.The main limitation of the model is the information available.'
 'There is only complete information of five countries: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia.There is not enough information for certain emerging diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, so this study can be updated as the research on the different diseases transmission routes progresses.In the same way, there are countries without information available, for lack of declaration on the current health situation or underreporting of diseases outbreaks.Once the model is complete, could conduct an annual or biannual review to update the variables and parameters in use, to obtain an updated risk analysis that allows detecting potential dangerous routes of entry by an increase in the risk from the previous period.This work has made possible to assess the risk of entry of different infectious diseases at the same time, and through different routes of entry into a large geographical area.The use of spread sheets for the development of probabilistic formulation has been of vital importance for the collection and analysis of data, although its validity depends on the confidence and quality of the available information.'
 'In the case of vector-borne diseases it is possible by vectors dispersion in wind currents, and in the case of foot and mouth disease it is possible by virus spreading through wind currents.Due to the absence of live dromedary movement to Europe, the more likely way of entry of the Middle East respiratory syndrome is through infected people movement, from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman.The contagious bovine pleuropneumonia is the only disease with no risk of introduction in the European Union, due to the absence of cattle movement from the countries affected by this disease, Chad, Niger, Mali, and Mauritania.Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.']

['The detailed study of FWPV and CNPV has been driven largely by their use as vaccine vectors for poultry and human vaccines [5] .Avipoxviruses have been identified as the causative agent of disease in a wide range of avian species -a review of available literature reveals natural infections described in at least 232 species in 23 orders of birds [6] .'
 'Such uses are not without risks as the vaccines themselves should always be considered as having the potential to cause disease in the vaccinated species.Many of the commercial vaccine strains of FWPV and CNPV have been used as the basis for the development of recombinant poxvirus vector-based vaccines for control of other avian diseases or for use in non-avian species [5] .'
 'The availability of full-genome sequences for one FWPV strain and one CNPV opens the possibility of rational attenuation of viruses for the development of new avipox vaccines or to enhance specific immunogenicity characters where the avipoxviruses are used for the delivery of antigens and/or immunomodulators to avian and non-avian hosts [5] .'
 'The potential for emergence of new FWPV strains or the spread of other avipoxviruses into commercial poultry production systems is real; however, the timing and consequence of emergence of such viruses is not predictable.Avipoxviruses have been identified as the causative agent of disease in a wide range of avian species (for review see [6] ).'
 'Expression of REV protein has been reported; however, the co-isolation of REV and FWPV in the culture systems could be an explanation for the apparent expression of REV genes from the FWPV carrying integrated REV provirus [45, 49] .The selective advantage conferred on FWPV strains carrying the REV provirus is probably related to the immunosuppression caused by the concurrent REV infection [25] , leading to a longer and more severe FWP infection, thus extending the duration of possible transmission by contact or mosquitoes.'
 'Upon removal of the REV provirus from two field strains and FPV-S vaccine strain of FWPV, we have not been able to identify marked differences in disease produced in chickens infected at 3-4 week of age (Boyle, unpublished) .Removal of the REV LTR has been considered desirable by some for the use of FWPV strains for poultry vaccines or as vaccine vectors [5] .'
 'The safety profile of such recombinants is now well established, as a significant number of such recombinants have been subjected to regulatory A substantial understanding of the molecular biology of the orthopoxviruses was essential to the construction of the first vaccinia virus recombinants.It was subsequently shown that the avipoxviruses share many basic features with the orthopoxviruses, particularly in the control of gene expression, e.g.'
 'The seminal observation of their utility for delivery of vaccine antigens to non-avian species has driven much of the interest in this group of viruses to the extent that rFWPV and rCNPV have undergone extensive clinical trials in humans for vaccines against HIV/AIDS and in treatment regimens for cancer patients.']

['In addition, a number of studies from different countries have shown that hCoV-NL63 can be recovered from respiratory secretions of both immunocompetent children and immunocompromised adults (Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Boivin et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Gerna et al., 2006a; Moës et al., 2005) .In Italy, hCoVs 229E, OC43, and NL63 have been shown to circulate both in the past and present time (Gerna et al., 1978 (Gerna et al., , 1980 (Gerna et al., , 2006a .'
 'In addition, human metapneumoviruses were detected by both MAbs (DFA and culture) and RT-PCR as previously reported (Gerna et al., 2006b; Percivalle et al., 2005) .'
 'In addition, in-house developed MAbs were used for identification of: (i) human metapneumovirus group and type (Gerna et al., 2006b; Percivalle et al., 2005) ; (ii) hCoV 229E strains (Gerna et al., 2006a) ; (iii) hCoV HKU1 strains.'
 'For the other hCoV infections, the predominant clinical symptoms are reported in Table 3 .Results of the present study indicate that hCoV HKU1 has been circulating among hospitalised patients in northern Italy during the winter-spring season 2005-2006 along with the other three known hCoVs.'
 'The two recently discovered hCoVs, NL63 (Fouchier et al., 2004; Van der Hoek et al., 2004) , belonging to group I, and HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005a) , belonging to group II, along with the widespread use of molecular techniques allowing detection of conventional respiratory hCoVs 229E and OC43 (McIntosh et al., 1970) , have contributed to the consistent increase in detection of hCoV-positive respiratory specimens.'
 'The high specificity of the HKU1-specific MAb was shown by negative DFA results obtained in a large series of NPA smears positive for other respiratory viruses, including OC43, 229E and NL63, while the level of sensitivity appears promising for diagnosis of HKU1 infections.'
 'Similarly, a pool of three different 229E-specific MAbs for the prospective diagnosis of 229E infections appeared to be a valuable alternative to RT-PCR.Two genotypes of HKU1 (A and B) have been reported (Lau et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2005b) .'
 'Following the initial report describing the association of HKU1 infection with pneumonia in two adult patients, an epidemiological and clinical study extended to the entire patient population in Hong Kong reported a predominance of upper ARTI, in agreement with the present study (Woo et al., 2005b) .In conclusion, HKU1 was circulating in the winter-spring season in northern Italy among hospitalised immunocompetent children and immunocompromised adult patients.']

['Presence or absence of the biomarkers of the MR score was interpreted in relationship to the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval, placental inflammation, and early-onset neonatal sepsis for all neonates admitted to the Newborn Special Care Unit (n ¼ 104).'
 'In this study, proteomic analysis of amniotic fluid was shown to be the most accurate test for diagnosis of intra-amniotic inflammation, whereas addition of the MR score to the Gram stain provides the best combination of tests to rapidly predict infection.Preterm delivery remains a major public health problem with lasting family and societal repercussions [1] .'
 'This suggests a sequential appearance of the biomarkers in women with intra-amniotic inflammation/ infection.We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to examine the relationship between the severity of inflammation (MR score) and the duration of the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval.'
 "Women with PPROM and ''severe'' inflammation had significantly shorter amniocentesis-todelivery intervals compared with women with both ''mini- We further determined that the presence and the severity of acute inflammation in the chorionic plate, amnion, choriodecidua, and umbilical cord were significantly associated with the occurrence and the degree of intra-amniotic inflammation as determined by the MR score ( Table 3 )."
 'Suspected and confirmed sepsis in the neonatal period were associated significantly with an MR Performance of the MR Score and Other Rapid Markers in Identification of Intra-amniotic Inflammation and Infection Table 5 shows the estimates of the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of each method for the identification of women with intra-amniotic inflammation.'
 'Addition of IL-6 and MMP-8 to the model did not improve the prediction value of an AF culture result.When clinical variables such as maternal age, gravidity, parity, GA at amniocentesis, history of prior preterm delivery, cervical dilatation, and presence of uterine contractions or clinical chorioamnionitis were also introduced into the logistic regression model, none had significant or additive value for prediction of either infection or inflammation.Because AF inflammation is thought to be an important risk factor for neonatal morbidity and mortality, we tested the relationships between the AF MR score, the WBC count, IL-6 and MMP-8 levels, and glucose concentration in order to confirm our premise that MR scores of 1 and 2 reflect a lesser degree of inflammation, whereas an MR score of 3-4 indicates a more severe inflammation.We found that women with MR 3-4 had higher (1) The median time required to perform and report the final results for glucose and LDH levels was 48 min (range: 21-353) and 6.9 d (range: 2.'
 'Certainly the findings of the current study are stimulating and set the stage for prospective randomized studies to determine the need, the duration of the antibiotic exposure of the newborn following delivery, and the long-term neurological outcome of the infant according to their AF MR score and or the treatment of choice made on the basis of the MR score.One of the strengths of the present study in comparison with other studies is the inclusion of all amniocentesis samples in a prospective fashion rather than a predetermined selection of biological samples from diverse tissue banks.'
 'This again argues in support of the high accuracy of the MR scoring in detecting intra-amniotic inflammation as reflected by the AF WBC count, but also by the pathologic evaluation of the placenta.In summary, in this study proteomic profiling of the AF was shown to be the most accurate test to identify women with intra-amniotic inflammation and assess the degree of neutrophil activation in the setting of preterm labor.']

['5 In response to the urgent need for infection prevention and control (IPC), as exemplified by the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a global IPC unit in 2016, which incorporates core elements of IPC structure, measures to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and guidelines on the management of common HAIs such as surgical site infections (SSIs) and catheter-associated blood stream infections; this links up with the WHO Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programme and with outbreak control.'
 'Given the scarcity of resources, infrastructure and low compliance by healthcare workers, the implementation of adequate infection control activities including the protection of healthcare workers and visitors remains a significant challenge.To address these issues, a group of infectious diseases experts from around the world, with representation from high-, middle-, and low-income countries, attended a workshop held at the 17th International Congress on Infectious Diseases in Hyderabad, India in March 2016, to assess the gaps in IPC programmes in LMICs, such as training and education requirements, and to identify approaches that could be better adapted to the needs of the individual countries, in order to guide IPC in practice.'
 'This article describes the highlights of that discussion.The workshop started with an introduction outlining the need for applied research and the development of practical IPC guidelines appropriate to the local context by the chairs of the Education and Publications Committee and the Research Committee of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID).'
 'The major drawback for IPC in South Africa is that it is not currently recognized as an independent subspecialty in the country, increasing the urgent need for structured career paths.In response to traveller and pilgrim needs, a free IPC app for healthcare workers and the public has been developed by ICAN in collaboration with the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO-EMRO).'
 'Also, the concept of IPC is not included in the regular curricula of medical or nursing schools, therefore reducing IPC exposure and knowledge during the formative stages of trainees.The IPC resources in Jamaica and the Caribbean are both government-and hospital-based.'
 'Changing the behaviour of healthcare workers would be of benefit in improving and sustaining adherence to infection control guidelines, with special importance given to the directors of the IPC programme to maximize utilization of the resources at their disposal and obtain the best possible results.Since 2009, Cambodia has had policies, strategic plans, 42 guidelines, and regulations in place for IPC, healthcare waste management, 43 and combating AMR.'
 "It should be noted that most IPC programmes have been created by and are currently supported by the country's MoH.In contrast, two of the countries represented at the working groupthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nepalboth lack robust IPC programmes."
 'Lastly, in Cambodia, Jamaica, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, financial support continues to be a limiting factor for IPC programme implementation.The recent literature suggests various strategies to assist in the prevention of HAIs, including the implementation of bundles and other infection control measures.']

['With our present knowledge and testing procedures, there is less need for words because the approach to successful protection is relatively straightforward and simple" (McClelland and Gillespie, 1966) .Active immunity against canine distemper in dogs can be achieved by the use of various types of vaccines.'
 'Active immunization became very successful after live attenuated vaccines became available: ferret-passaged modified vaccine, modified hen egg virus vaccine (Haig, 1956) , modified cell culture virus vaccines (Rockborn, 1959) , heterotypic measles vaccine, and combined vaccines.Purified vaccines (Norrby et al., 1986) and ISCOM vaccines (de Vries et al., 1988) prepared over the past few years remain at an experimental stage.At present, modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are used on a large scale: in 1992 approximately 27.5 X lo6 doses of vaccine were used in the U.S.A. for a population of 53 X lo6 dogs, while in France in 1993,4 X lo6 doses were used for a population of 9.9 X lo6 dogs.'
 'However, despite a less intense response for the CDVo strain, all dogs were seropositive and totally protected against virulent challenge one year after a single vaccination.In the case of multiple combined vaccines, and despite satisfactory compatibility tests, we have often observed that the CDV antibody kinetics were always poorer (for a given route of administration and an identical vaccinal titre) in a group of dogs receiving the combined vaccine than in a group receiving only the distemper component.'
 'Nevertheless, complete protection against a distemper challenge was still observed in both groups of dogs.Besides the intrinsic qualities of a vaccine, the presence of residual maternally-derived antibodies can be a problem at the time of primary vaccination.'
 'Thus maternally-derived antibodies, whilst beneficial for early protection against the infection, disturb the vaccinal immunization.It could be postulated, as has been shown in the case of canine parvovirus (Burtonboy et al., 1991) , that vaccines with high titres are likely to be more effective in the presence of residual maternally-derived antibodies.'
 'The second should be given to puppies around 12-14 weeks of age, by when a complete disappearance of passive immunity is expected and the vaccine should be completely effective (Chappuis et al., 1974; Terre et al., 1978) .For an active booster effect, it is possible to increase the level of preexisting active antibodies by revaccination.'
 'The potency of the same recombinant ( vVRG) was demonstrated in the canine species (Chappuis et al., 1994) .Experimental vaccines prepared from poxvitus recombinants (vaccinia, fowl pox or canary pox) including genes F and H of measles virus and of canine distemper virus have been tested in mice (Wild et al., 1993) but mainly in dogs.'
 'This new approach offers the prospect of positive developments and further improvements in the control of canine distemper.I would like, as a conclusion, to quote from Max Appel ( 1987) : "Eradication of CDV, as has been suggested for the related measles virus in man, may be desirable but is not possible.']

['The turn-around time for the assays, not including extraction, is within 2 h.The objective of this study was to compare the clinical performance (using actual clinical respiratory samples) of the two multiplexing strategies represented by the FA-RP (Version 1.7) and AnyplexII RV16 (Version 1.1), with that from a more conventional, two-plex RT-PCR kit represented by respiratory virus assays from the Argene (Biomerieux, France) range.The research study protocol was submitted to the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board (CIRB Ref No.'
 'The distribution of microorganisms detected in the samples used for this study is shown in Supplemental Table 1 .The FA-RP, AnyplexII RV16, and Argene assays (comprising Adenovirus/Bocavirus, Coronavirus/PIV, Influenza A/InfluenzaB, RSV/ MPV, and Rhinovirus/Enterovirus) were highly similar in their targets.'
 'For all three platforms, only results from valid runs were used for calculations in this comparison study.An approach of extended (composite) reference was used for the interpretation of results: that is, a true positive was defined as being positive by two or more of the three platforms compared.To facilitate comparison, for cases where targets were reported as a group, identification to correct group would be considered as a concordant case when compared with another assay that may provide more a specific identification.'
 'There were 28 Influenza specimens in this study covering all categories of Influenza A results except the "H1 subtype" category.The overall performance of all three platforms was comparable, with sensitivities and specificities ranging from 95.8% to 97.9%, and from 96.1% to 98.0%, respectively.'
 'One discordant case was observed (CoV and RSV by FA-RP, CoV by Argene and AnyplexII RV16), suggesting that dual positive samples can be diagnosed accurately using FA-RP, Argene and AnyplexII RV16.There were 7 specimens that represented Influenza A "no sub-type" or "equivocal" results, as reported by FA-RP.'
 'All four "equivocal" samples were Influenza A positive by Argene, but in-house test and AnyplexII RV16 were negative for two of the samples.'
 'This translated to 99.2% sensitivity and 96.9% specificity of the FA-RP method using UTM samples.Among the ETT samples, 9 out 10 samples which were tested positive by FA-RP turned out to be positive on composite gold standard.'
 'FA-RP had an overall sensitivity of 84.5%, with substantially lower sensitivity noted for detection of adenovirus [3] .There are comparatively fewer evaluations of AnyplexII RV16, but in a comparative study in 2013, the assay was reported to have an overall sensitivity of 95.2% [12] .In this comparative study, the FA-RP, AnyplexII RV16 and Argene assays were noted to have comparable sensitivities and specificities of 97.9% and 96.1%; 97.2% and 97.1%, and 95.8% and 98.0%, respectively.']

['The codon usage information for the MERS-CoV strains might provide some clues to the characteristics of the MERS genome and the evolutionary history of the virus.The compositions of the 32 human related MERS-CoV, the 24 camel related MERS-CoV, the 12 bat related MERS-CoV and the 3 hedgehog related MERS-CoV were analysed and shown in Table 1 .'
 'The SD value, calculated for different kinds of isolates based on the nucleotide abundance (Supplementary Table 2 ), showed that the value of A and U were small in the four nucleotides in the MERS-CoV human/camel isolates, although it was lowest in the CoV hedgehog isolates and largest in the CoV bat isolates, respectively.'
 'However, the CoV isolates from bat showed a larger amount of variation.The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) value of each synonymous codon in the MERS-CoV genome was calculated (Table 2) , which indicated that codon usage bias exists in the coding sequence of the MERS-CoV genome.'
 'Hence, this analysis suggested that the composition of the nucleic acids affected the codon usage pattern of MERS-COV.To further investigate which factors account for the low codon usage bias of MERS-CoV and the related viruses, we analysed the relationship between the ENC value and the percentage of G or C in the third site of codons (GC3s) % in MERS-CoV genomes.'
 "The ENC values of the coding regions of these strains were plotted against the GC3s ( Figure 2 ).It's shown that the observed value was smaller than the expected value, which indicated that the codon usage bias patterns exist in these MERS-CoV strains."
 'This was also in accordance with the SD values of the RSCU of the MERS human/ camel isolates; (2) In addition to mutational pressure, there are other factors, such as natural selection, which might influence the codon bias of MERS-CoV of human/ camel isolates; (3) CoV of Tylonyteris, Pipistrellus and Erinaceus europaeus have distinct codon usage patterns compared with the MERS-CoV human/ camel isolates: in the plots, the data points were closer to the axes than to the origin; (4) The codon usage bias patterns of Tylonyteris, Pipistrellus and Erinaceus europaeus CoV were not only caused by mutational bias, but also by natural selection pressure, which might have had a larger effect than mutational bias.Natural selection plays an important role in codon usage bias of MERS-CoV and its related strains.'
 'Additionally, the evolution rate of the GC3s was very similar to that of the GC12s, indicating that compared with the natural selection pressure, the mutational bias played an increasingly important role in shaping the MERS human/camel codon usage pattern.Then the possible connection between the codon usage pattern and the evolution of sequences/genes were further investigated.'
 'There was a significant variation in codon usage bias between MERS-CoV human/camel isolates and the CoVs isolated from bats and hedgehogs.The codon usage bias of MERS-CoV was different in the isolates of the latter two hosts, in which nature selection pressure played an important role in the codon usage bias.']

['Though known to be an issue for millennia, there has lately been an increased interest from the scientific community, and EIDs are now considered to be a major microbiologic public health threat [4] .In this review, after an historical review, we will first explore the factors associated with emergence of bacterial pathogens; next we will address the approaches that may be used to confirm their pathogenic role in humans; and finally we address future challenges.During the last 40 years, at least 50 emerging infectious agents have been identified [5] ; approximately 10% of them are bacterial agents [6] .'
 'With that in mind, three main aspects need to be discussed to understand the dynamics of bacterial diseases emergence: (1) development of new diagnostic tools, (2) increase in human exposure to bacterial pathogens and (3) emergence of more virulent bacterial strains and opportunistic infections.Identification of a bacterium traditionally depends on culture.'
 'Finally, cell culture played a significant role in the identification of emerging bacteria, as many of the recently discovered species are strict intracellular bacteria.'
 'This PCR has been used to detect emerging pneumonia-associated pathogens [35] as well as to demonstrate the common presence of Chlamydiales in ticks [36] .To summarize, molecular amplification techniques are extremely powerful to identify unknown bacteria.'
 'Second, they are highly sensitive, with a detection limit as low as five copies, and are therefore extremely useful to detect bacteria after empirical antibiotic treatments or in cases of latent infections, such as Q fever in cattle, for which PCR has been shown to be extremely useful to identify animals with active shedding [37] .'
 'During the last century, major sociodemographic and environmental changes have disrupted the dynamic equilibrium that exists among humans, prokaryotes and their environment and has led to an increase in human exposure to some environmental pathogenic species, as well as person-to-person transmission of commensal bacteria.Sociodemographic changes.'
 "Currently the increasing density of the population, especially in hospital settings, and the increasing use of invasive procedures have increased healthcare-associated infections, such as Clostridium difficile infections, which now represent a significant public health challenge [42] .In addition, today's populations have not only increased in number but have also increased the speed and rate by which they move across the earth, enabling rapid spatial dissemination of pathogens."
 'Additionally, such patients may be at risk of severe infections due to environmental bacteria, such as Capnocytophaga canimorsus, that has now emerged as a cause of septicaemia in splenectomized or cirrhotic patients bitten by dogs [59] .Recent advances in microbiologic diagnosis have enlarged the number of identifiable prokaryotes, making it more difficult to determine the ones that are pathogenic from beneficial or harmless microbes.']

['The WHO has called for at least US$675 million to fund critical response efforts in countries most in need of help through April 2020.The above and other content indicate that the WHO (2019) framework on Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management (Health-EDRM) has no apparent role in the current response strategies.'
 'Certainly there is no mention of disaster at all within the WHO Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) technical guidance, particularly on the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, regarding Operational Planning Guidelines to Support Country Preparedness and Response (WHO, 2020).Also at the global level, the UN Office for DRR [8] issued a press release on the 12th of March 2020 urging disaster management agencies to prioritize biological hazards.'

 'We organise the review by the regions.The first known case of COVID-19 emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan on December 12,019 and was deemed an emergency in the third week of January 2020. WHO declared COVID-19 (the "new coronavirus") a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 31st of January 2020, and finally a pandemic on 11th March 2020.'
 "The country allocated more than $13 billion in emergency funds to stoke economic activity.Taiwan, on the other hand, used 2003 SARS experience to prepare from the beginning through strict countermeasures as well as big data analysis of people's movement and thereby identifying the possible areas of spread of COVID-19.Singapore is another case where an initial surge was observed in the number of affected people."
 'The Indonesian government has prepared a budget of Rp 1 trillion, or around $70 million, to be channelled through the Health Ministry to try to contain the Covid-19 outbreak and care.India, with the second largest population in the world, has taken early precautionary measures through travel and visa bans on foreigners from certain countries, mandatory health checks and self-quarantine for 14 days.'
 'In addition, the health sciences should be more involved in the community of disaster risk management, to advance our understanding of outbreaks and pandemics, the health impacts of all hazards, and improve data collection [15] .']

['PCR was concluded to be a reliable, highly sensitive and specific tool for detection of C. suis [16] .The present study aimed to investigate the presence of Chlamydia spp in the intestines of growing pigs and in conjunctival swabs from finisher pigs, and relate those findings to the occurrence of clinical signs.The study was approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments, Uppsala, Sweden.'
 'in the south-western and eastern parts of the country, and included 36 pigs from six herds with poor performance and diarrhoea in growing pigs, and 12 pigs from four herds with good performance and no diarrhoea.'
 'By histology, lesions that may be consistent with chlamydial infection [9] were noted in 20 pigs: Villus atrophy was noted in six pigs with diarrhoea and in ten control pigs from the poor performance herds.'
 'Epithelial exocytosis or necroses were noted in five pigs with diarrhoea, in one control pig from the poor performance herds, and in one pig from the good performance herds (Table 1) .In the previous study [17] , Brachyspira pilosicoli were demonstrated in eight case pigs and five control pigs, Campylobacter jejuni; in one case pig and four control pigs, Yersinia enterocolitica in three case and five control pigs, haemolytic Escherichia (E.) coli in two case and two control pigs, Clostridium perfringens in two case pigs, and L. intracellularis were previously demonstrated in 11 case and eight control pigs from the poor performance herds.'
 'Coronavirus was not included in the study, since Sweden has previously been shown to be free from Table 1 The findings in intestinal specimens from growing pigs with diarrhoea (case), clinically healthy control pigs from the same poor performance herds (casecontrol), and from healthy pigs originating from good performance herds (control), examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), necropsy, and PCR.'

['With the increasing numbers of elderly patients being transplanted, this review will highlight the knowledge about transplant [both solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)] recipients infected with respiratory viruses and make note when there is a specific impact on the aging transplant patient.The prevalence of RVIs in any given season depends on a combination of factors: the method of exposure, types of circulating viruses, virulence of the virus, and the detection methods used.'
 'Similarly, a case-control study noted that acute rejection or a C 20% decline in the forced expiratory volume occurred in 33.3% of patients with RVI [9] .More specific studies focusing on the epidemiology of community respiratory viruses in allogeneic HSCT patients have shown that rhinovirus and coronaviruses are common, followed by adenovirus and RSV [13, 14] .'
 'Almost one-third of patients (32.5%) developed lower respiratory tract disease, including pneumonia in almost half of patients over age 60 years; age and lymphopenia were significant risk factors for severe disease.Investigators also reported a 6.3% mortality rate for A/H1N1 infection or its complications.The presentation of influenza in transplant patients can be nonspecific, especially in elderly recipients.'
 'ILI criteria are not validated for use in the transplant community; one study showed that the positive predictive value for the definition of ILI in transplant recipients was only 50% and resulted in the overuse of antivirals and missed diagnoses of other respiratory viruses [44] .Lower respiratory tract infections including bacterial superinfection occur in up to one-third of transplant patients with influenza.'
 'Peramivir is also an option for influenza virus resistant to oseltamivir and has been used in cases of oseltamivir resistance in transplant recipients [58] .Although antivirals should be started as early in the illness as possible, they may remain effective even after 48 h of symptoms and can be used at any point during the illness [59, 60] .'
 'Ribavirin has been the mainstay in treatment for RSV infections and can be given in the aerosolized, oral, and intravenous formulations.'
 'Type 4 is less common, and its epidemiology is under study [29] .Similar to the other respiratory viruses, PIV is associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection in transplant patients.'
 'The use of ribavirin has also been studied, although the effectiveness is difficult to assess because of lack of controls [134, 138] .Rhinovirus A, B, and C circulate year-round and are a common cause of upper respiratory tract infection in transplant recipients in various studies.']

['(1992) measured a frameshifting efficiency of 13.7% for G UUU UUC (in the context of the minimal IBVbased 3′-adjacent pseudoknot) and comparison of the frameshifting efficiencies measured for G GGU UUU and G GGU UUC or U UUU UUU and U UUU UUC suggest that the frameshifting efficiency of G UUU UUU should be of the order of 20-33% in the minimal IBV-based context, i.e., as efficient as G GAU UUY.Identification and bioinformatic analysis of fifo in cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River virus, Aedes flavivirus and cell silent agent Analysis of the CFAV, KRV, AEFV and CSA sequences also revealed the presence of a long −1/+2 frame fifo ORF overlapping the NS2A/ NS2B region in addition to a potential ribosomal frameshift site near the 5′ end of the fifo ORF.'
 'However, the currently available sequence data for these viruses do not cover the NS2A/ NS2B region and thus it remains to be seen whether the genomes of these viruses also harbour the fifo ORF.Sequence analysis of the predicted FIFO protein NS2A and NS2B are among the least conserved proteins in an amino acid comparison between CxFV and CFAV (23% and 19% amino acid identity, respectively; Hoshino et al., 2007) , and the FIFO amino acid sequences are even more divergent (Fig.'
 'If the published predictions (summarized in Hoshino et al., 2009 ) are correct, then it is interesting to note that the location of the frameshift site relative to the cleavage site differs substantially between the two insect-specific flavivirus clades (NS2A codons 28 and 29 in CxFV, but NS2A codons 3 and 4 in CFAV, KRV and AEFV).'
 "In favour of this new site, the −3 and −1 amino acids are V and G in CxFV and A and A in QBV, while the old site has −3 and −1 amino acids I and A in CxFV and I and N in QBV; thus, the new site appears to be more consistent with the '-1, -3' rule for signalase cleavage.Separate Abs were raised against two predicted 14-aa CxFV FIFO antigensone within the C-terminal region of CxFV-Mex07 FIFO (FIFO Ab 1) and the other within the N-terminal region of CxFV-Iowa07 FIFO (FIFO Ab 2)."
 'Thus, it is not clear whether the ∼38 kDa band is a nonspecific artifact or if FIFO is not readily detected by western blot due to the relatively low frameshifting efficiency estimated for CxFV (∼6%; see Analysis of the proposed site of frameshifting).In order to test the proposed site of frameshifting, the slippery heptanucleotide and 3′-adjacent local sequence from CxFV and CFAV were cloned between two ORFs in vector pF25A ICE such that − 1 frameshifting produces a fusion product of the two ORFs.'
 'Thus, it is clear that the G GAU UUY motif and 3′adjacent sequence are capable of stimulating significant levels of frameshifting in both viruses.The considerable difference in the efficiencies measured for CxFV and CFAV is of interest, and may be related to the 3′-adjacent stimulatory structurea simple hairpin in CxFV but a pseudoknot in CFAV.'
 'Belshaw et al., 2007) , resulting in a short 45-codon ORF in the JEV-serogroup and the much longer fifo ORF in the insect-specific flaviviruses.While scenarios (i) and (ii) would explain independent evolution of both frameshifting and the conserved location of frameshifting near the 5′ end of the NS2A coding sequence, scenario (iii) appears to explain just the evolution of frameshifting rather than the precise location of frameshifting.'
 'Evidence includes (i) the conserved presence of a long − 1/+ 2 frame ORF overlapping the NS2A/NS2B region of the polyprotein coding sequence despite N1000 phylogenetically independent base substitutions within the region, (ii) a statistically highly significant enhancement in the conservation at polyprotein-frame synonymous sites in both a CxFV-QBV alignment and a CFAV-KRV-AEFV-CSA alignment; (iii) a well-defined and conserved translation mechanism via programmed ribosomal frameshifting at the 5′ end of the ORF; (iv) reporter assays confirm the viability of the proposed translation mechanism; and (v) immunofluorescence assays with two separate Abs raised against different regions of FIFO reveal the specific presence of proteins containing FIFO antigens in CxFV-infected cells.This discovery adds to a small number of known cases of overlapping genes that are internal to large polyprotein coding sequences in RNA viruses and accessed via well-defined programmed ribosomal frameshifting sites (as opposed to low level accidental translation of alternative reading frames; cf.']

['The 2411 SDE genes identified (corrected P < .05) were concordant with those identified using all controls: 772 of the top 800 SDE transcripts between RSV and youngest controls were represented, with the same direction of expression, in both data sets.The biological pathways distinguishing H1N1/09, RSV, and bacterial infections from controls were investigated with IPA, which assigns SDE transcripts to known biological functions and pathways.'
 'Protein synthesis-related transcripts with increased expression included genes with known inhibitory functions in protein synthesis, including EIF2AK2, IFIT1/ISG56, and IFIT2/ISG54 (fold change [FC] of 3.9, 10.0, and 4.0, respectively, in H1N1/09 relative to controls) [5, 6] .To validate our findings, we used a publically available adult data set for H1N1/09 and controls [4] .'
 'Of 69 transcripts in the top canonical pathway (EIF2 signaling), 32 were SDE in the validation data set (31 with the same direction of regulation; Supplementary Figure 2B ).To identify unique aspects of the transcription profile of H1N1/09 infection, we compared expression in H1N1/09, RSV, and bacterial infection.'
 'Transcripts that were SDE between H1N1/09 and RSV (n = 601 of 7295 transcripts, corrected P < .01) and between H1N1/09 and bacterial infection (n = 734 of 6808 transcripts, corrected P < .01) were used for unsupervised clustering and for classification, H1N1/09 patients were distinguished from RSV ( Figure 1B ) and bacterial patients ( Figure 1C ) with accuracy of 93% and 92% for H1N1/09 vs RSV and H1N1/09 vs bacteria, respectively (Supplementary Data 1 and 2D and 2E).'
 '"Protein synthesis" was the most significant functional category in both the H1N1/09 vs RSV, and H1N1/09 vs bacterial infection data sets (corrected P = 2.73 × 10 −13 and 1.6 × 10 −11 , respectively).'
 'The most significant canonical pathways were related to protein synthesis: eIF2 pathway (P = 2.0 × 10 −20 and 9.0 × 10 −10 ), eIF4 (P = 4.7 × 10 −8 and 0.006), and mTOR (P = 8.1 × 10 −7 and 0.016) for H1N1/09 vs RSV, and H1N1/09 vs bacterial infection, respectively (Figure 2 and Supplementary  Data 3 and 4) .Marked differences were observed between RNA transcriptional profiles in H1N1/09-infected patients compared to RSV and gram-positive bacterial infection or controls.'

 'In an influenza A challenge study of adult volunteers, differential expression of translation initiation pathway genes was identified in symptomatic but not subclinical infections [12] , supporting a role for altered protein synthesis as a key component of the host response to H1N1/09 infection.Increased expression of protein synthesis-inhibiting genes with reduced expression of translation initiation genes is likely to impair protein synthesis.']

['This manuscript is a review of normal pregnancy endocrinology and physiology and reported abnormalities of pregnancy in domestic cats.The three principal hormones of pregnancy, estradiol-17b, luteinizing hormone and progesterone, are secreted to varying extents throughout the gestation period in queens.During the first half of gestation, serum concentrations of estradiol-17b fluctuate around baseline, with one-half of queens showing a significant rise approxi-mately 1 week before parturition [1] .'
 'Serum luteinizing hormone concentrations also fluctuate around baseline in the first half of gestation but remain low until the time of parturition [1] .The concentration of progesterone in serum rises after either spontaneous or induced ovulation and it must be present throughout gestation for pregnancy to be maintained.'
 'Administration of a prolactin-inhibiting drug, cabergoline, in the latter half of gestation caused a decrease in serum progesterone concentration and from 88% to 100% of treated queens subsequently aborted [4, 6] , suggesting that corpora lutea are the primary source of progesterone during pregnancy in cats.'
 'Knowledge of the source of gestational progesterone alters diagnostic methods used for assessment of pregnancy loss and affects the choice of drugs and regimens to be used for pregnancy termination in cats.Progesterone, from whatever source, varies in extent of secretion during gestation, with peak serum values of 11-60 ng/ml reported after the first mating [1] .'
 'By the time of parturition, queens should have gained 12-38% of their pre-pregnancy body weight [7] .Super-fecundation, the presence of offspring from more than one sire in a single litter, is reported to commonly occur in cats.'
 'Surgical removal of the fetal tissues and supporting structures is the usual treatment.Torsion of one or both uterine horns occurs rarely in queens, but onset most frequently occurs in the latter half of pregnancy, from the fifth week to parturition.'
 'Catteries with adequate hygiene are unlikely to develop a problem with pregnancy loss due to bacterial infection.Feline leukemia virus is a retrovirus with horizontal transmission that is most commonly found in cats from multi-cat households and in cats allowed outside exposure to other cats.'
 'Cats with a history of exposure to feline leukemia virus that successfully fight off infection and become non-viremic still appear to be more susceptible to infectious disease, stressing the importance of avoidance over vaccination or treatment [35] .Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is another cause of pregnancy loss in queens.']

['In the absence of evidence supporting a splicing process in coronavirus RNA synthesis (12) (13) (14) , the most likely mechanism for the origin of DI RNA, the one presumed in this review, appears to be template strand switching by the RNA polymerase from a donor template to an acceptor template of the same polarity during replication of a virus genome or of a previously formed DI RNA (15) .'
 'Thus, in the microenvironment of the recombination site a short region of sequence identity might play a role in the mechanism of strand switching.Many of the coronavirus DI RNAs appear to have the same attributes ascribed to DI RNAs of other RNA viruses (17) (18) (19) , namely, the ability to competitively inhibit parental virus genome replication and to show a numerical abundance inversely related to that of the helper virus genome.'
 'The presence of a 7-nt consensus sequence motif at the 3Ј end of the genomic leader (UCUAAAC for MHV and BCV, ACU-AAAC for TGEV, and CUUAACA for IBV) and at intergenic regions on the virus genome has suggested a sequence-directed leader fusion event during RNA synthesis (12) (13) (14) 30) .'
 '2A2 ) (52) .The leader-priming model, therefore, whether it be applied to leader fusion during subgenomic mRNA synthesis or to leader switching, describes a recombination event that requires a free leader, long-distance polymerase jumping (assuming the leader remains attached to the polymerase), and a 3Ј = 5Ј exonuclease activity to trim the excess leader sequence before resumption of RNA synthesis.Polymerase strand-switching models for the high-frequency, site-specific leader recombination events accompanying coronavirus leader acquisition.'
 'This model postulates that polymerase is attenuated at the UCUAAAC sequence during synthesis of the subgenomic minus-strand RNA template and switches to a plus-strand leader template to complete synthesis of the subgenomic minus-strand RNA template (49, 53) .'
 'It follows that the UCUAAAC intergenic elements serve as attenuators of polymerase synthesis during minus-strand synthesis and promote polymerase strand switching to copy a leader supplied in cis by the 5Ј end of the genome (53), or possibly in trans by another mRNA (36, 43), to generate a leader template for synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs.'
 'The second model, therefore, in contrast to the first, does not require that there be a free leader (and thus a mechanism to discriminate between free leader synthesis and genomic RNA synthesis), long-distance polymerase jumping (i.e., nonprocessive synthesis), or a 3Ј = 5Ј exonuclease processing of the leader during the crossover event.This model, with some variation, can also explain leader switching between the 5Ј terminus of DI RNA and helper virus genome (Fig.'
 'In a recent series of experiments to examine the role of the UCUAAAC element in leader switching, mutations in and around the leader and its flanking sequences were made on the BCV DI RNA, including deletion of the UCUAAAC element, and tested for leader switching (36) .']

['This study reported the cumulative relative risks for mortality and outpatient visits of all causes and cardiopulmonary diseases associated with eight standardized cold-temperature indices-average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and THI, WCI, AT, ET, and NET.We obtained vital statistics from the Department of Health, Taiwan, universal health insurance claims from the National Health Research Institutes, daily meteorological data from the Central Weather Bureau, Taiwan, and daily air pollution data from Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration, for the period between 2000 and 2008.'
 'Therefore, the cumulative RRs of cause-specific mortality and outpatient visits were estimated by comparing the risk associated with the standardized values (Z) of − 1 and − 2 (i.e., at the 15.9th and 2.3th percentiles, respectively) with that at Z of 0 or 1 (i.e., the 50th and 84.1th percentiles of average temperature in the study cold periods) for each cold-temperature index (the centered values in DLNMs).'
 'The extremely low temperature (Z b − 2) was also associated with an increased number of all-cause outpatient visits; however, the risk varied slightly with cold-temperature indices.The temperature-health associations varied with the type of health outcome and the applied cold-temperature indices ( Supplementary  Fig.'
 'Using the standardized temperature at Z = 1 with the lowest mortality as reference, the cumulative RRs for mortality from circulatory diseases increased significantly at the average temperatures of Z = − 1 and − 2 for 48% and 78% in Taipei, 36% and 61% in Central Taiwan, and 49% and 63% in Southern Taiwan, respectively.'
 'Cold had no effect on mortality from respiratory diseases.Minimum temperature was the best to predict the association between cold temperatures and number of outpatient visits.'
 'The prolonged adverse effect of low temperature lasted longer in Central Taiwan than in Taipei and Southern Taiwan, in which the cumulative RRs showed a plateau after 20-day and 10-day lags, respectively.This is the first study to assess relationships between cold temperatures and mortality from and outpatient visits for all causes, circulatory diseases, and respiratory diseases using several common cold-temperature indices in Taiwan, which is located in subtropical Asia.'
 'These studies indicated that low temperatures have greater adverse effects on mortality from cardiovascular disease than on mortality from respiratory diseases (1997; Barnett et al., 2005; Ha et al., 2009; Huynen et al., 2001) .Contradictorily, from the present study it appears that temperature may have a significant relationship with only outpatient visits for respiratory diseases in the 3 study areas and all causes in Southern Taiwan.'
 'For the relationship between cold temperature and respiratory outpatient visits, minimum temperature is the best index (Anderson and Bell, 2009; Barnett et al., 2010) .This study did not evaluate how mortality and outpatient visits may be associated with RH and WS, which are regarded as important variables that could affect perceptions of temperature for exposed population.']

['Zoonotic transmission by ingestion of contaminated meat, mainly from pigs, is the most likely zoonotic source of infection (1) .Recently, HEV sequences were reported from 3 dromedaries sampled in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2013 and were classified as a new orthohepevirus A genotype, HEV-7 (2, 3) .'
 'To determine the geographic distribution of HEV-7, we conducted a geographically comprehensive study of HEV-7 prevalence in dromedaries by testing 2,438 specimens sampled in 6 countries during the past 3 decades.Serum and fecal samples were collected from dromedary camels in the UAE, Somalia, Sudan, Egypt, Kenya, and Pakistan during 1983-2015 (5-7).'
 'All camel HEV clustered in a monophyletic clade with the human HEV-7 sequence (Figure 2 ), supporting the classification of camel-associated HEV to a separate Orthohepevirus A genotype (11) .African viruses from Somalia and Kenya formed a monophyletic clade, whereas viruses from UAE and Pakistan were intermixed ( Figure 2 ).'
 'The African viruses were 16.7%-22.7% distant from UAE and Pakistan viruses, which corresponds to the distance threshold of 22%-25%Author that separates the prototype HEV-4 sequence from HEV-5 and HEV-6 prototype sequences.'
 'Using this cutoff, we found 96 (46%) of the 210 serum samples originating from all 6 countries were positive (Table) , which is comparable with the seroprevalences typically observed in pigs that are known zoonotic reservoirs for HEV-3 in developed countries (13) .'
 'The broad spatial extent, the high diversity of HEV-7 in dromedaries, and the detection of HEV-RNA in a sample collected in 1983 suggest a long evolutionary history of HEV-7 in dromedaries.Our study has some limitations.'
 'However, our study and previous studies (12) showed that HEV-7 and other human genotypes form 1 serotype, suggesting a lack of discrimination in seroprevalence studies.The human HEV seroprevalence in the Middle East region might in fact be caused by HEV-7 infection.'
 'Furthermore, human HEV-7 infections might contribute to the HEV prevalence in all studied areas, where camel products are frequent parts of human diet (15) .']

["Our hypothesis was that patients sharing bays (small self-contained areas within wards) with patients with symptomatic norovirus infection were more likely to become infected compared to those who were in another bay or part of the affected ward.We carried out enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks from all in-patient wards in five tertiary care hospitals serving two cities in England, with a combined catchment of approximately two million people.We collected data during outbreaks from individual patients on date of onset of illness, symptoms (diarrhoea and/or vomiting), last date of illness for each patient, location on the ward at the time of the patients' symptoms onset (recorded as bed number and bay number) and also the ward type.For two hospitals, information was recorded on specially designed forms that were completed We obtained ward plans for two of the five hospitals, which assisted in locating patients in the ward if only part of the information on patient location was recorded in the outbreak reports."
 'We used a previously described approach to calculate the probability, π ij , that patient i was infected by patient j for each pair of infected patients in each outbreak based on onset times and the serial interval distribution (the serial interval is the time from onset of symptoms in case i to case j), without using proximity data [13, 14] .We then used the matrix of π ij values to simulate 1000 possible infection trees for each outbreak, by assigning the infector of patient i to be patient j with probability π ij.In these simulations, we assumed that the case with the earliest onset time was the index case and had no infectors on the ward.'
 'Using the gamma probability distribution derived from a community outbreak by Heinje et al [13] (mean serial interval 3.06 days), the proportion of observed proximity values fell within the range that would be expected if proximity were not important.The results show that the proximity metric (P) was larger than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis (that proximity is not important) up to a serial interval of 2.5 days (p=0.05).'
 'This showed no pattern and the proximity measures were not significant for any of these models.We used more than one approach to modelling the infection trees because of the lack of data on serial interval in norovirus outbreaks.'
 'We used the time between the first two cases of each outbreak to estimate the serial interval for norovirus in this setting.This distribution and dates of illness onset were used to calculate epidemic trees for each outbreak.'
 'Sensitivity analysis using different values of the serial interval showed that there was evidence to reject the null hypothesis provided the assumed serial interval was less than 2.5 days.Our results provide evidence that patients occupying the same bay as patients with symptomatic norovirus infection are at an increased risk of becoming infected by these patients compared with patients elsewhere in the same ward.'
 'We used a previously described approach to calculate the probability, π ij , that patient i was infected by patient j for each pair of infected patients in each outbreak based on onset times and the serial interval distribution (the serial interval is the time from onset of symptoms in case i to case j), without using proximity data.'
 'An overall proximity metric, P, is obtained by summing the P k values.The value of P (and of P k for individual outbreaks) should be interpreted as a measure of how much transmission occurs between patients in the same bay.If people in the same bay pose a greater risk of infecting each other this will tend to lead to larger values of the proximity metrics, P, and P k. We compared this observed metric with values obtained if proximity was not associated with transmission.']

['To test this report further, the objective of the current study was to characterize the susceptibility of A. diaperinus populations from southern Brazil to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos and to estimate diagnostic concentrations for resistance monitoring programs.To determine the susceptibility data to insecticides, populations of A. diaperinus were collected in poultry farms in southern Brazil, where there is the highest number of broiler farms in the country (Table 1 ; Fig.'
 'Based on the LC 99 values, candidate diagnostic concentrations were designated for the resistance monitoring of A. diaperinus to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos in Brazil.There was significant variation in the biological activity of cypermethrin against A. diaperinus larvae (Table 2 ).'
 'A similar susceptibility to chlorpyrifos was observed in larvae from the Lab, RS-1, RS-2, and SC-2 populations, with LC 50 values ranging from 0.21 to 1.26 µg a.i./cm 2 .'
 'This population also had the highest resistance ratio to chlorpyrifos of more than 20-fold (Table 3 ).There was also significant variation in the susceptibility to chlorpyrifos in adults from distinct Brazilian populations of A. diaperinus (Table 3) .'
 'A similar susceptibility to chlorpyrifos was observed in adults from Lab, populations collected in broiler farms of Rio Grande do Sul (RS-1, RS-2, and RS-3) and Santa Catarina (SC-1, SC-2, and SC-3) states, with LC 50 values ranging from 0.17 (population Lab) to 1.13 (population RS-2) µg a.i./cm 2 (Table 3 ).'
 'Based on these values, the candidate diagnostic concentration of 12 µg a.i./cm 2 can be considered for the resistance monitoring of A. diaperinus (larvae and adults) to chlorpyrifos in Brazil.The larvae and adults from southern Brazilian populations of A. diaperinus presented significant interpopulation variation in the observed susceptibility to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos.'
 'The susceptibility of A. diaperinus larvae to these insecticides, based on LC 50 values ranging from 0.43 to 7.33 µg a.i./cm 2 and 0.21 to 4.30 µg a.i./cm 2 , represented resistance ratios of 17-and 20-fold, respectively.'
 'A lower resistance ratio, inferior to threefold, was also verified to chlorpyrifos and tetrachlorvinphos in larvae from broiler house facilities in Arkansas (Steelman 2008) .High variation in the susceptibility to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos was also observed among adult populations of A. diaperinus from southern Brazil.']

['In 1996, a strain of CCV was isolated from the liver of an acutely died giant panda deriving from Wolong Reserve, P. R. China, which further verified that it was a causative agent to giant panda.'
 'Whether it is necessary to use CCV vaccine to protect this precious animal should be researched, in order to answer these questions, the 62 sera samples of giant panda were collected from zoos and reserve regions in Sichuan Province, China and used for serological investigation of neutralizing antibodies against CCV.'
 'Medium in monolayers MDCK cell used for neutralization test was moved and 100-#L virus-serum mixtures were transferred to each well of the plate.'
 'The plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 ~ in a CO2 incubator and then the virus-serum mixture was removed from each well.'
 'The highest dilution which can completely protect the cell from CPE was taken to be the viral antibody titer.The 62 serum samples of giant pandas were assayed under the preceded conditions of optimization.'
 "(1994) carried out serological survey of CCV in giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in the Wolong Reserve, China, he found that 3 sera samples in 8 giant panda's sera were CCV antibody positive, which indicated that CCV may infect giant panda and induce neutralizing antibody against CCV."
 "In our study, 62 sera samples of giant panda were detected by VNT, which indicated that CCV infection was universal in giant panda's populations.Since it was very difficult to distinguish CCV infection from other pathogen infection such as CPV-2, enteric bacteria, parasites, poisonings and non-infectious causes of diarrhea, laboratory confirmation was necessary in clinic diagnosis (Evermann et aL 1980; Tennant et aL 1998; Keenan et aL 1976; Yasoshima et al."
 'PCR for the diagnosis of CCV infection revealed high specificity and sensitivity, but it also required the qualified experts to perform.The VNT is a sensitive and specific assay to the diagnosis of CCV by detecting specific antibody.']

['TCoV ORF1b was more conserved than ORF1a, as TCoV ORF1b showed a 59% identity to groups I and II coronaviruses, and 93% identity to IBV which is a group III coronavirus.As with other coronaviruses, TCoV was characterized by the presence of 4 major tructural genes, located in the 3 one-third of the genome: spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nuclocapsid (N) protein genes (Fig.'
 'The presence of Gene 3 and Gene 5 were highly suggestive that TCoV was related to group III coronaviruses.'
 'Although the distance between the putative TRS and the downstream initiation codon varied among the various genes in the TCoV genome, the particular distance for each gene was similar in both IBV and TCoV.'
 'The solid support for the monophyly of TCoV-MG10 with four IBV isolates supports the conclusion that this TCoV should be classified as a member of the group III coronaviruses.Analyses of aligned amino acids sequences for the E, N, and S proteins of various coronaviruses produced phylogenetic trees that largely reflected the nucleic acid-based whole genome trees (Fig.'
 'In TCoV-MG10, Gene 5 has two small ORFs (ORF5a and ORF5b) that code for products of 65 and 82 amino acids, respectively; this is identical in length to the Gene 5 products of IBV.'
 'A study is required to understand the functional difference in S for IBV and TCoV, which may have a great impact on the antigenic properties and tissue tropism of both IBV and TCoV as well as the development of control measures against them.The presence of Gene 3 and Gene 5 is a unique characteristic for group III coronaviruses as those genes do not exist in mammalian coronaviruses.'
 'As those genes are highly conserved in avian coronaviruses, they might serve as a cis acting elements essential for virus replication.Based on the overall structure of the genome and sequence similarities to IBV, we conclude that TCoV should be classified as a group III coronavirus.Our sequence data revealed the presence of a novel ORF in TCoV located upstream of Gene 5 and downstream of the M gene.'
 'This ORF is unique to TCoV and IBV, the only Group III coronaviruses for which sequence data in this region of the genome are available.']

['Numerous products targeting various processes in the innate immune response are either currently available and moving toward human trials or in the initial stages of development.In-depth investigation into opportunities offered by innate immunity for biodefense is currently lacking.Innate immune cells use pathogen recognition receptors to recognize pathogen macromolecules to provide an immediate response with broad specificity.'
 'Further studies must demonstrate not only the efficacy but also the safety in the case of TLRs and those products that increase IFN levels.3M Pharmaceuticals has developed a class of immune response modifiers (IRMs) that act by stimulating TLR7 and TLR8 and have exhibited antiviral and antineoplastic activity in human subjects.'
 '4 Aldara is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in the treatment of actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, and genital warts.3M Pharmaceuticals plans to use compounds selective for activation of TLR7, TLR8, or both by using an influenza virus challenge with cytokine response and immunity as outcome measures.'

 'Biweekly treatment of human patients up to 1 year has been safe, with no cases of harmful inflammation or autoimmune activation seen in the thousands of human subjects treated with thymalfasin to date.'
 'Thymalfasin has been approved in more than 30 countries and is in phase III testing in the United States (to be completed by year end 2005).Recent evidence suggests that among TLRs in airway epithelial cells, TLR3 activation resulted in the greatest increase of innate immune response.'

 'CEL-1000 is in the early stages of development, and thus there are many unanswered questions regarding safety in human subjects and its therapeutic range.SciClone proposes use of SCV-07, a dipeptide immunomodulator originally developed in Russia, to stimulate the innate immune system in the setting of BTA.']

['The details of the method to test the significance of the impact of SARS on cancer incidence are presented in Supplementary Information.'
 'Year 2003 had a lower number of ALL, in particular the standard-risk ALL subtype and Common ALL below the age of 10 years.'
 'The impact of SARS period for the standardrisk and common ALL (SR) subtypes was significant as shown by the F-test for the indicator variable D (P ¼ 0.0110).'
 'The decline in the incidence of ALL, in particular the standard-risk ALL, in 2003 is probably the result of social isolation during SARS and thus less exposure to triggering environmental factors.'
 'The avian influenza cluster in the same year probably also raised the alertness of infection preventive measures in the community.The hypothesis of naïve immune system during infancy, associated with higher incidence of ALL in later life, will be an interesting subject in the SARS setting.'
 'Since the peak age of ALL is 2-6 years, any trend of increased incidence may be detected in the coming few years.In the 2 years post-SARS period, we did not see any increase in the incidence of ALL.'
 'The reduced incidence of ALL was only confined to the standard-risk ALL.'
 'In conclusion, we observed a reduced incidence of standard-risk ALL in children during the SARS period.']

 'Furthermore, haplotypes of IL10-rs1800872 had significant correlation with the increase of risk for early pregnancy loss [52] .In conclusion, IL-4 rs2227288 and IL-10 rs1800872 may lead to increased risk in relation to virus-induced encephalitis.'
 'It remains unknown in our study whether IL-4 rs2227288 and IL-10 rs1800872 gene polymorphisms affect the levels of IL-4 and IL-10 and subsequently participate in the pathogenesis of encephalopathy.']

['If milk shipment data can be shown to be a reliable means for disease surveillance, we hypothesize that they can be used to assess resilience by monitoring the variability in the routine bulk tank milk shipment volumes.The first objective of this study was to explore the challenges and possibilities of using milk shipment data as a source of information for disease outbreak surveillance.'
 'However, only 93 herds (54 organic and 39 conventional) had all of the required milk shipment and milk size data and were included in the analyses.'
 'In 27 out of 93 herds the milking system changed from conventional milking systems to AMS during the study period.Both milk shipment and herd size data were available for the period of 1 Apr 2012 to 26 Nov 2015 and these were the data used in the analyses.'
 'Total milk shipped was converted to milk per cow per day based on the length of the interval between shipments and the estimated number of cows milking.A herd management data file was obtained from the Swedish Official Milk Recording Scheme.'
 'Given that there were only (on average) 1.29 sub-herds per herd, all of these split records were treated as separate herds and are referred to as such from here on.To account for the repeated measures nature of the data, a correlation structure was applied to the residuals.'
 'Given the potential for these herds to be very influential in the regression model, they were removed and two new data sets created (cln20r and cln15r).Prior to data cleaning, but after merging of the different data sets, the data set cln20 consisted of 59,010 shipment dates from 94 herds over the period of 1 April 2012 to 26 November 2015.'
 'A limitation in the analysis was that the 27 herds that transitioned from non-AMS to AMS during the study period were treated as separate herds before and after the transition as they were too few to add another level to the random structure in the model.'
 'Well aware of the shortcomings in the quality of data and the choice of measure of resilience in the present study, we could not find any support for our hypothesis, as the variance of daily milk volume per cow did not differ consistently between production system, across various data cleaning procedures, stratification strategies or models built.Evaluating disease monitoring The possibility to use data collected on a daily basis to provide real time information about herd health is appealing.']

['When tested against reference bovine Breda virus, Bar 1 serum did not react with Breda 1 serotype, but reacted slightly with Breda 2 serotype; Bar 2 serum reacted slightly with Breda 1 serotype and strongly with Breda 2 serotype ( Beards et al., 1984 ) .After 1 h incubation in a wet chamber at 37°C and overnight at 4 °C, the serum-virus mixtures were pelleted in a Beckman "Airfuge" at 30 000 Xg for 10 min.The resulting pellets were resuspended in 50 tll of distilled water and stained as described above.Human rectal tumor cells (HRT 18) were prepared in tubes and in LAB-TEK chambers ( Miles Laboratories), using RPMI 1640 growth medium with 15% fetal calf serum (FCS).'

Inoculated and control cells were allowed to react separately with one of the following: (i) monoclonal anti-bovine coronavirus A 912 Ab (provided by J. Laporte) ; (ii) bovine convalescent serum from 736 (1) calf (this serum was previously adsorbed with bovine rotavirus concentrated from a MK 2 cell culture supernatant) ; (iii) rabbit anti-bovine rotavirus serum produced in our laboratory (Lamouliatte-Jambon, 1982) .'
 'Bovine coronavirus was used as positive control.Convalescent sera from two Breda virus-positive calves (736 (1) Ab and 92 (4) Ab ) and rabbit anti-bovine coronavirus antiserum (BCV F 15 Ab), which had been adsorbed with rat erythrocytes and diluted 1/40 in PBS, were used in the test in place of fetal calf serum; the purpose of this procedure was to obtain inhibition of hemagglutination and thus to attempt to identify the antigenic character of the hemagglutinating fecal particles.'
 'The Breda virus used for this process was the Freon-treated, filtered 736 (1) fecal supernatant and BCV was obtained from infected HRT 18 cells (Laporte et al., 1979) .One hundred and twenty milliliters of 736 (1) sample and 90 ml of clarified supernatant of BCV-infected cells were ultracentrifuged for 60 min at 95 800 xg in a 45 Ti rotor (Beckman).'
 'Anti-bovine rotavirus conjugate (peroxidase labelled) was added and left for 90 min at 37 ° C. The substrate was incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and the plates were then read on a Titertek Multiscan at 492 nm.Of the 21 diarrheic samples, 13 contained Breda viruses in variable amount, three contained both Breda and rotaviruses, two contained coronaviruses, two were positive for rotaviruses by EM and ELISA and one did not contain any virus.'
 '1  ( E ) ), Breda viruses observed both in feces and in cell culture supernatants did not present double rows of spikes.In most samples, the particles were isolated (or aggregated if the fecal supernatant had been ultracentrifuged), but in two cases large spontaneous aggregates were seen.The morphology of the bovine Breda agent is similar to that of human particles seen both in mild diarrhea and in necrotizing enteritis ( Fig.'
 'Two samples diagnosed as Breda virus positive did not generate viral particles at a level detectable by IF or EM (Table II) .In our experiments, the hemagglutinating property was not associated with all strains of Breda viruses since four samples did not produce any rat-erythrocyte hemagglutination, including the 736 (1) sample containing very numerous particles.Hemagglutination inhibition performed on samples whose hemagglutinating titer was >/1/16 yielded the following results: anti-BCV serum did not significantly inhibit the hemagglutination of Breda virus-containing samples; convalescent sera from Calves 736 (1) and 92 (4) reduced the hemagglutination of only two Breda virus-positive samples out of three, and of one coronavirus-positive sample.'
 'We observed such particles either after purification of Breda viruses and bovine coronaviruses or in Breda-positive cell-culture supernatants.Bovine Breda viruses are related to human Breda-like particles, but not to bovine enteric coronavirus as shown by IEM; some isolates reacted to a great extent with Breda 1 or Breda 2 sera from the U.S.A. and probably represent members of these serotypes.Preliminary results of in vitro culture associating cellular degenerative process, positive IF and presence of Breda particles in the supernatants allow us to assume that certain strains could have replicated.']

['[6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Most cases of acute bronchitis occur in otherwise healthy adults, in whom this acute cough illness can be called "uncomplicated acute bronchitis"; these principles are intended to apply to such patients.'
 'The evaluation of adults with an acute cough, illness, or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia.College of Chest Physicians defines acute cough illness, in contrast to chronic or persistent cough, as lasting less than 3 weeks.'
 'Therefore, in the absence of severe airflow obstruction, it is prudent to limit evaluation for possible chronic asthma or cough-variant asthma to patients with cough illness lasting longer than 3 weeks.When evaluating an otherwise healthy adult with uncomplicated acute cough illness, the primary diagnostic objective should be to exclude the presence of pneumonia.'
 'As a group, these agents are associated with 5% to 10% of all cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis in adults.'
 'Since Gram stain and culture of sputum do not reliably detect M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, or B. pertussis, these tests are not recommended in the evaluation of patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.On the basis of the microbiology of acute bronchitis, it should not be surprising that randomized, placebocontrolled trials have failed to support a role for antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis (Table) .'
 'All three meta-analyses reported no impact of antibiotic treatment on duration of illness, limitation of activity, or loss of work, and all concluded that routine antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis in adults is not justified.Identification of cases of bacterial or mycoplasmaassociated bronchitis might seem to be a reasonable strategy for selecting patients in whom antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial.'
 'The randomized, placebo-controlled trials of albuterol have reported mixed results in identification of subsets of patients most likely to benefit from treatment; therefore, treatment should be individualized in patients without clinical evidence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (such as wheezing or bothersome cough).'
 'Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician-patient communication rather than whether an antibiotic is prescribed [B] .4.0 Clinicians caring for patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis should be encouraged to discuss the lack of benefit of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute bronchitis and stop prescribing antibiotics for this condition as a standard of practice.']

['Similar to the diagnosis of AIH in the general population, it has to be acknowledged that the diagnosis of de novo AIH following liver transplantation is not clear-cut.While we lack evidence-based diagnostic criteria to distinguish the differing entities, there are strong similarities between de novo AIH, the recurrence of AIH in liver transplant recipients, and the classical AIH in the non-transplant setting.'
 'It is notable that the frequency of de novo AIH may be higher than the prevalence of AIH in the general population, probably because transplant patients are exposed to more potential risk factors [20] .With regard to immunosuppression usage, liver transplant recipients maintained on CsA had a 4-fold lower risk of de novo AIH, whereas those receiving tacrolimus or mycophenolate mofetil had a 4-and 6-fold higher risk of de novo AIH, respectively ( Figure 2 ) [20] .'
 'In other words, having a younger male donor and primary use of CsA is protective against the development of de novo AIH.Similar to patients with PBC, the immunosuppression regimens used in the 1990s probably contributed to the cohort effect observed in this study.'
 'It is tempting to speculate, therefore, that the penetrance of recurrent disease maybe related in part to the acquisition of protective alleles in the new allograft that prevents establishment of an infectious process but data are lacking to support this conjecture.The recurrence of PBC following transplantation strongly suggests an infectious process and epidemiological data are suggestive of a transmissible etiology as well.'
 'However, a major factor that has reproducibly been shown to be protective at this juncture is the primary use of CsA.Little is known about the etiology and pathogenesis of AIH in the non-transplant setting and the development of de novo AIH remains a total mystery.'
 'In the setting of liver transplantation, this model would also be consistent with the antiviral and anti-lymphocytic activity of CsA in protecting against the development of de novo AIH.The observation that the more potent immunosuppressant, tacrolimus is associated with earlier and more severe recurrence of PBC suggests two potentially compatible hypotheses.'
 'In this case, inhibition of the cyclophilin A interaction with HIV capsid by CsA impairs the passage of the mature viral core to the nuclear pore complex.Following proviral integration, cyclophilins have been shown to play a role in several processes in the viral life cycle comprising viral RNA and protein production, assembly and maturation (Figure 3 ).'
 'In contrast, cyclophilin inhibitors trigger loss of the HIV Vpr protein-a known partner of cyclophilin A-independent of proteosome activity [80] .As discussed for our in vitro experiments with MMTV producing cells, it is unlikely that the cyclophilin inhibitors impact on any of the steps from viral entry to viral transcription and protein production given that CsA and NIM811 treatment did not impact on MMTV RNA or protein levels in cells [19, 73] .']

['Also, several laboratories have reported that CsA suppresses the replication of various kinds of CoVs [25] [26] [27] .In this review, we focused on the relationship between CsA and the replication of CoVs, and introduce some of the recent advances in this area.CoV replication relies on a variety of host factors, which also constitute potentially interesting targets for antiviral therapy [28] .'
 'also examined whether CsA might exert an inhibitory effect on CoV replication by inhibiting Cyp function and by indirect inhibition of virus-specific function; however, they found that the activity of nsp12, an RdRp in SARS-CoV, was not directly affected.'
 'In addition, depletion of cellular CypA or CypB by knockdown experiments did not significantly affect SARS-CoV replication; however, it is possible that remaining Cyp in the small interference RNA (siRNA)-treated cells was sufficient to support normal virus replication.SARS-CoV Nsp1 is an in vivo virulence factor whose action has been linked to the early stages of the immune response, including antagonistic activity against interferon signaling and inhibition of host protein synthesis [36, 37] .'
 'However, it appears that the inhibition effects of CsA on virus replication are independent from the NF-AT pathway.'
 'The Cyp-CsA complex may inhibit the other functions of Cyps that are required for virus replication.Using GFP-expressing recombinant equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), de Wilde et al.'
 'CsA inhibition of CypA function may suppress the production of SARS-CoV progeny.Cyps may affect the conformation of the viral RdRp or the RNA template, which in turn could alter the template activity of the RdRp [16, 17] .'
 'If the N protein of Coronaviridae family viruses such as SARS-CoV binds to Cyps, it is possible that Cyps act as a chaperone for the N protein and play an important role in replication.CD147-CypA interaction plays a critical role in HIV-1 infection [46] .'
 'Little is known about the exact role of CypA in CoV replication and how CsA inhibits virus replication by binding to Cyps.']

['The problem of managing and extracting useful knowledge from these data sources is currently one of the most popular topics in computing research [3, 4] .In this context, big data is a popular phenomenon that aims to provide an alternative to traditional solutions based on databases and data analysis.'
 'The concept of social big data can be defined as follows:"Those processes and methods that are designed to provide sensitive and relevant knowledge to any user or company from social media data sources when data sources can be characterised by their different formats and contents, their very large size, and the online or streamed generation of information.'
 'However, given the very large heterogeneous dataset from social media, one of the major challenges is to identify the valuable data and how analyse them to discover useful knowledge improving decision making of individual users and companies [18] .In order to analyse the social media data properly, the traditional analytic techniques and methods (data analysis) require adapting and integrating them to the new big data paradigms emerged for massive data processing.'

 'The intersection between big data and social media is reflected in some social media applications such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Youtube that are currently using big data technologies (Mon-goDB, Cassandra, Hadoop, and so on) to develop their Web systems.Finally, the centre of this figure only represents the main goal of any social big data application: knowledge extraction and exploitation.The rest of the paper is structured as follows; Section 2 provides an introduction to the basics on the methodologies, frameworks, and software used to work with big data.'
 'Section 3 provides a description of the current state of the art in the data mining and data analytic techniques that are used in social big data.'
 'The aim of this study has been to provide a holistic view and insights for potentially helping to find the most relevant solutions that are currently available for managing knowledge in social media.As such, we have investigated the state-of-the-art technologies and applications for processing the big data from social media.'
 'The paper has avoided describing or analysing those straightforward applications such as Facebook and Twitter that currently intensively use big data technologies, instead focusing on other applications (such as those related to marketing, crime analysis, or epidemic intelligence) that could be of interest to potential readers.Although it is extremely difficult to predict which of the different issues studied in this work will be the next "trending topic" in social big data research, from among all of the problems and topics that are currently under study in different areas, we selected some "open topics" related to privacy issues, streaming and online algorithms, and data fusion visualisation, providing some insights and possible future trends.In the era of online big data and social media, protecting the privacy of the users on social media has been regarded as an important issue.']

 'A study in young children reported that although the lung microbiota was distinct from the microbiota of the URT, it was dominated by species that are also present in the URT, including Moraxella spp., Haemophilus spp., Staphylococcus spp.'
 'Given the low density and presumably transient microbiota in the LRT, it could be speculated that the diversity of this microbiota is shaped by interbacterial relationships to a lesser extent than bacterial communities in the URT, although little is known about the level of proximity and likelihood of interbacterial effects.Bacterial associations that are detected in epidemiological surveys may also indicate the existence of joint host or environmental drivers and not the presence of direct or indirect microbial interactions per se.'
 'The biological mechanisms that underlie these bidirectional interactions have been extensively studied, although mostly for viruses and bacteria that are known to cause respiratory diseases 102 .One of the main modes of action by which respiratory viruses are thought to predispose individuals to bacterial disease is through the disruption of the airway-epithelial barrier, which facilitates the adhesionThe respiratory microbiota has been hypothesized to control mucosal immunity in early life and contribute to immune tolerance.'
 'To date, the exact role and breadth of the mechanisms by which fungi contribute to a healthy equilibrium in the respiratory tract have unfortunately remained unstudied.Although studies suggest the importance of both the respiratory virome and mycobiome in respiratory health, there is a considerable knowledge gap in their exact contributions to health compared with the role of the bacterial microbiome.'
 'However, current evidence provides an important basis for further in-depth analyses of the interactions that exist between bacteria, viruses and fungi, as well as the effect of host and environmental factors on these interactions.As there are a vast number of commensals and potential pathogens that inhabit the mucosa of the respiratory tract, a delicate equilibrium has to be maintained between immune sensing and tolerance of nonpathogenic commensals, and the containment of resident pathogens and new invaders.']

 'Active daily monitoring of cats for signs of stress or adjustment should be performed, and staff should record their findings daily, noting trends and making adjustments in the care of individual cats and the population as indicated.In animal shelter environments, proper behavioral care of cats also requires an understanding of the wide spectrum of feline lifestyles and an approach tailored to the individual needs of each group.'

 'The reduction in the number of RV-infected foci in siRNAs expressing cells compared with control cells indicated inhibition in RV multiplication.'
 'The levels of RV-L and N mRNA in the siRNAs expressing and RV-infected cells were significantly reduced compared with control cells.'
 'Since RV-N and L proteins have interrelated effects on virus multiplication [24] , siRNAs targeting RV-L and N genes exhibited nonsignificant difference in inhibition of RV multiplication.In the next step, the siRNAs expressing lentiviruses were analyzed for inhibition of RV multiplication in vivo in mice against virulent RV challenge.']

['In order for gene expression data to become accepted for routine use in HHRA, it is necessary to demonstrate that mRNA/protein expression profiles can effectively predict the modes of action and biological outcomes of exposure at relevant doses, and to confirm that these data can be used to strengthen the foundation for HHRA and regulatory decisions.'
 'In addition to the examination of BMDs and BMDLs, we compare CBNP-modified gene expression profiles to various models of lung disease in mice and humans reported in the literature, in order to explore the utility of our data in predicting the potential risk of adverse health outcomes and the human relevance of expression changes.'
 'BMDs that exceeded the highest exposure dose (162 g) and that exceeded a goodness-of-fit p-value of 0.1 were removed from the analysis.To determine the correlation between gene expression profiles of mice exposed to CBNPs with those of mouse pulmonary disease models, a prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM) (Tibshirani et al., 2002) was conducted in R (R Development Core Team, 2011) using the PAMR library (Hastie et al., 2011) .'

 'However, previous analyses of 5 chemicals (i.e., 1,4-dichlorobenzene, propylene glycol mono-t-butyl ether, 1,2,3-trichloropropane, methylene chloride and naphthalene) showed that median BMD and BMDLs for the most sensitive pathways and GO categories were highly correlated with BMD and BMDLs of cancer and non-cancer endpoints (Thomas et al., 2011 .In the current study, rather than choosing the most sensitive (i.e., lowest) BMDs, we focussed on the analysis of pathways that were specific to biological outcomes observed in the mice (i.e., phenotypically anchored), and calculated BMDs for these relevant genes and pathways.'
 'In order to determine the specific utility of pathway derived BMDs in HHRA, it will be necessary to establish a comprehensive catalogue of pathways that are actually perturbed in the event of specific adverse effects.Perhaps the principal motivation for including gene expression profiling in HHRA is the wealth of information that can be used to identify key events that are correlated with adverse outcomes that are relevant to human disease, and moreover can be used to predict the likelihood of a human disease.'
 'These data demonstrating very similar fibrotic pathways in mice and humans and a significant overlap with CBNP-induced gene expression changes thus support the use of pathway-based approaches in identifying molecular mechanisms of disease onset and progression, and using gene expression profiles to support HHRA.This study confirms several key elements that are necessary for the application of gene expression profiling for HHRA of toxicant exposures in general.']

 'Our results are in agreement with the current literature and, considering that the tested animals were not treated or vaccinated before and after the transport, the reported data support the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after the tested journey.'
 'Interestingly, an increase in positivity towards BCoV, BRSV, H. somni, P. multocida, M. haemolytica, and M. bovis was observed, while neither BVDV nor BoHV-1 were ever detected.As already demonstrated [4] , the nasal microbiota tested in the present study showed changes when the DNS before the transport and after the arrival at the feedlot in Italy were compared.'
 'However, regardless of its origin, the high prevalence of H. somni required a more in-depth control of this pathogen in feedlot cattle, and more careful attention and investigation before shipping.The other pathogens found were associated with time, with animals more likely to be found positive four days after the tested journey, thus, other factors, such as transport stress and the epidemiological status of the herd at arrival, may have played an important role.'
 'It is important to highlight that, in our study, DNS collected from the animals at the local farm were positive only for BCoV, thus the epidemiological status of the herd at arrival may be one of the reasons for the higher prevalence of this virus found in the DNS at T1.']

 "Although a recent study suggests that the effects of Xrn2 that are observed on HCV RNAs could be indirect , it will be interesting to see if this alternative 5'-3' exoribonuclease can also be stalled by 5' UTR structure.In addition to stalling Xrn1-mediated degradation of flavivirus transcripts, the embedded RNA structures also appear to repress the enzyme."

['In the following it is shown how application of these techniques in experiments utilizing monoclonal antibodies can be made in the study of all areas of virological research.The reaction of a single antibody with an epitope is characterized by the equilibrium constant of the combination; this is reflected in the binding assays described above (Section I).'
 'It is necessary therefore to perform a number of tests in order to extract the maximum possible information.Monoclonal antibodies provide us with a tool which is able to examine the individual protein within a structure as complicated as the whole cell.It is possible to investigate, both in uitro and in viuo, the role of a protein.It is also possible to determine the active areas of the molecule and to monitor its synthesis and processing within the infected cell.'
 'A function inhibihon assay has been applied to delineate that area of the SV40 T antigen involved in ATPase activity (Clark et d., 1981) and to demonstrate that some areas of the influenza and VSV nucleocapsid proteins may be associated with the transcription process (De et al., 1982; van Wyke et d., 1981) .Once epitopes are identified it is necessary to determine their topological relationship to each other on the surface of the molecule.'
 'The manner in which the sample is prepared can also influence the conformation and/or exposure of the reacting epitopes and this should be considered in the design of such experiments (Bruck et al., 1982b) .The second approach to the problem of arranging binding sites relative to each other is to select virus variants under monoclonal antibody selection pressure.'
 'A similar situation has also been demonstrated in influenza and may explain the separation of hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization exhibited by monoclonal antibodies specific for the HA protein of seal influenza .In just the same way as monoclonal antibodies provide a sensitive probe for virus detection in diagnosis (Section I1,A) so they can also be used to detect low amounts of individual virus proteins within the infectedcell.'
 'The application of the technique is exemplified in the purification of glycoproteins from HSV 1 and 2 (Eisenberg et al., 1982b) and the measles virus hemagglutinin (Bellini et al., 1981) .When used in RIA or ELISA monoclonal antibodies provide a convenient and accurate method for the quantitation of viral proteins (Lutz et al., 1983) .The study of a virus as a pathogen is more complicated than studies conducted in uitro.'
 'The altered epitope was also demonstrated to be the major site of recognition for virus specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (Finberg et al., 1982) .The use of monoclonal antibodies in the study of antigenic drift in influenza virus has already been discussed in the context of the structural information derived from such experiments (Section II1,A).'
 'However, use of monoclonal antibodies has demonstrated that the virus epitope to which the antibody is bound is also important.']

['Therefore, in this study, we demonstrate that MERS-CoV infection induced complement overactivation and led to severe lung damage, but that blockade of the interaction between C5a and C5aR alleviated tissue injury by reestablishing normal local and systemic immune responses, including reduced infiltration of tissue macrophages, inflammatory cytokine expression, and apoptosis of splenic cells and increased T cell regeneration.'
 'Overall, the results suggested that anti-C5aR Ab treatment could decrease both local and systemic inflammation, especially the T-helper type 1 (Th1) immune response induced by MERS-CoV infection, which may also contribute to tissue damage after MERS-CoV infection.To determine if complement activation influences viral replication, the viral titer in lung tissues, as well as antigen expression, was assessed.'
 'The results further indicated that the blockade of the C5a-C5aR axis could alleviate lung damage in hDPP4-transgenic mice, although an antiviral agent inhibiting MERS-CoV infection may be required in combination with the anti-C5aR Ab to increase the survival rate of MERS-CoV-infected mice.Clinically, MERS-CoV-infected patients have shown atypical pneumonia with dysregulated inflammatory responses.'
 'This result suggests that the anti-C5aR treatment could also suppress the inflammatory response and alleviate damage to brain tissues caused by MERS-CoV infection.Collectively, these results suggested that the severe outcome of MERS-CoV infection is related to host lymphopenia, which may be closely related to the overactivation of the complement system.'
 'However, blockade of the C5a-C5aR axis could decrease damage to lung, spleen, and brain tissues caused by MERS-CoV infection.According to a comparative study of SARS-CoV patients and the limited clinical data of MERS-CoV patients, immune-mediated pathogenesis was proposed as a potential factors in the severe outcome of MERS-CoVinfected patients.'
 'In this study, aberrant complement activation was confirmed in the lung tissues of mice after MERS-CoV infection, which prompted us to investigate the contribution of complement in the outcome of MERS-CoV infection.'
 'It is possible that regulation of the host immune response by complement improved the status of spleen tissue by decreasing splenic apoptosis and increasing the regeneration of splenic cells, indicating that induction of C5a production by MERS-CoV infection may contribute to the dysregulated immune responses, while blockade of the C5a-C5aR axis may improve outcomes by restoring normal immune responses.In summary, our study demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection can result in a dysregulated host immune response, which then contributes to the severe outcomes observed after infection.'
 'However, blockade of the C5a-C5aR interaction could alleviate tissue damage induced by MERS-CoV infection through the regulation of the host immune response, especially the apoptosis and regeneration of T cells in spleens.']

['The SAA protein has a short half-life: ~90 min in normal serum (Marhaug and Dowton 1994) , and the concentration of SAA in serum returns to normal following the termination of inflammation.The N-terminal region of the SAA protein is the precursor for the amyloid A (AA) protein, the first 10-15 amino acid residues of which are amyloidogenic (Marhaug and Dowton 1994) .'
 'The aim of this study was to determine if the SAA1A −97delG SNP in the putative NF-κB binding site of the SAA1A promoter is associated with a decreased production of SAA protein in vivo and if so, if the difference in AA amyloidosis prevalence between the wild and captive cheetah populations could be attributable to genetic differences at this locus.Banked cheetah fecal (n = 38) and serum (n = 20) samples from captive North American cheetahs were obtained from a repository at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Front Royal, VA, and National Zoological Park (NZP) in Washington, DC for genotypic and SAA protein analysis, respectively.'
 'Based on our analysis, the effect of the SAA1A −97delG allele is additive only, and explains ~2.7% of the total phenotypic variance in serum concentrations of SAA protein.Additional copies of the SAA1A −97delG allele are associated with a decrease in serum SAA protein concentrations (P = 0.1911 for the regression coefficient of a; Figure 1B ).'
 '90% of the total phenotypic variance in SAA protein concentrations remained unexplained by our model ( σ E 2 ).When examining the genotype frequencies of the SNP in the NF-κB binding site in the SAA1A promoter region of the captive North American and wild Namibian cheetah populations, there was no evidence to reject Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in either population, thus allele frequencies between populations were compared.'
 '2005) , suggesting that the amyloidosis observed in cheetahs is not of a true "familial" type and rather secondary to chronic inflammation.The identification of the SNP in the promoter region of the SAA1A gene in cheetahs by Zhang et al.'
 '(2008) suggested that AA amyloidosis in captive cheetahs may still be linked to genetic differences, as the SAA1A −97delG allele is associated with a decrease in transcription of the SAA1A gene in vitro (Zhang et al.'
 'Among the deceased cheetahs with known AA amyloidosis diagnoses, 88.5% of cheetahs confirmed positive for AA amyloidosis also had moderate to chronic inflammation of any kind, compared to only 28.6% of cheetahs confirmed AA amyloidosis negative at necropsy.In human populations, there is evidence that a SNP could explain population differences in secondary AA amyloidosis prevalence in rheumatoid arthritis patients: a thymine (T) nucleotide at the −13 position in the promoter region of the SAA1 gene is primarily associated with amyloidosis risk in these human populations (Moriguchi et al.'
 '(2012) study suggests that the population differences observed in allele frequencies are most likely due to an unrepresentative founder population or genetic drift within the captive North American population, as opposed to selection.This study was the first to demonstrate that the concentration of SAA protein in serum in captive cheetahs is associated with the SAA1A −97delG SNP in the promoter region of the SAA1A gene.']

['2.1, 2.5, 2.7, and 2.8) .The structure of the genome of poliovirus and comparison of it with the genomes of the other genera are shown in Fig.'
 'It is of interest that several viruses belonging to other families, such as hepatitis B virus (a virus that uses reverse transcription during the replication of its genome) and adenovirus (a DNA virus), have also adopted the strategy of using a protein primer for initiation of nucleic acid synthesis.The nature and function of the promoters in the poliovirus genome that are involved in the initiation of RNA replication are incompletely understood.'
 'Studies of immunity are made difficult by the finding that some fraction of the human population seems to be resistant to any particular Norwalk virus studied, perhaps because of a lack of receptors for the virus, and by the fact that there are so many viruses that cause gastroenteritis.The Norwalk group of viruses is worldwide in its distribution but epidemiological studies of these viruses have been difficult in the absence of a cell culture system or an experimental animal that can be infected by the virus.'
 'There is evidence from genetic studies that domains in nsP1 and nsP2, among others, are required for the recognition of viral promoters and the initiation of RNA synthesis, and additional helicase activity could also speed up the rate of RNA synthesis.During infection by alphaviruses, a subgenomic mRNA is produced that serves as the message for the production of the structural proteins of the virus, which consist of a capsid protein and two glycoproteins.'
 'It is assumed that a cellular protein binds the 3′ stem-loop of flaviviruses and interacts with the initiation complex so as to perform the same function as the poly(A)-binding protein.Formation of this complex in the case of flavivirus RNAs could be enhanced by cyclization of the viral RNA described later, although the primary function of cyclization appears to be in the replication of the viral RNA.The processing of the long polyprotein produced from the genome is complicated and is illustrated in Fig.'
 'Evidently the boost to the immune system from the second infection results in an increase in the amount and avidity of cross-reactive antibodies.Although infection by a second serotype is important for the development of DHF, it is also known that the probability of contracting DHF is in part a function of the virulence of the virus that is responsible for the second infection.'
 'The association of the virus with significant outbreaks of disease in humans, domestic animals, and birds, and the widespread dispersion of the virus in Eurasia and the Americas, appears to be the result of the emergence of a more virulent strain of the virus.'
 'It is known that at least some of these proteins are devoted to countering host defenses against viral infection, which is surely important for the persistence of the viruses in nature.The nonstructural proteins encoded in this domain of the genome include the two or three proteases described before, an RNA polymerase, an RNA helicase, and enzymes involved in capping that must perform functions similar to the corresponding enzymes in other (+)RNA viruses.']

['When caring for him, staff were advised to use personal protective equipment as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.'
 'This failure of infection control contributed to the public spread of panic, served as a wake-up call to the public health community, and helped convince the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that EVD should be treated only in specialized hospitals with highly trained personnel (2) .The following spring, a different deadly virus spread rapidly through a modern healthcare system.'
 'In South Korea, over the course of 2 months, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome led to 186 confirmed cases and 38 deaths; most of the patients contracted the virus within healthcare facilities (3) .These examples may be dramatic, but healthcare-associated infections are acquired daily and affect an estimated 4% of all hospitalized patients (4) .'
 'Since the practice of infection prevention and control became a specialty in the 1960s, healthcare-associated infections have decreased substantially (5) .'
 'New leaders in the field of infection prevention and control will always be needed.'
 'It is for these emerging experts that Lautenbach and colleagues have updated their book, Practical Healthcare Epidemiology, to a fourth edition.'
 'The chapter "Ethical Aspects of Infection Prevention," a subject that is often given short shrift, is itself worth the price of admission.The 56 listed contributors are a major source of strength, but they also contribute to the book\'s minor weaknesses.'
 'Practical Healthcare Epidemiology is valuable not just for its intended audience of new practitioners but for anyone involved in infection prevention and control.']

['This finding was followed by the detection of a closely related virus in archival samples from two Jordanian patients who died in April 2012 after unexplained respiratory illness [24] .The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in the year 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in 2012 showed that these viruses can cause fatal human disease (death rates were *11 % and *43 %, respectively) [6, 9] .'
 'Table 1 Multisequence alignment of the S1 protein and RdRp of MERS-CoV with those of different coronavirusesThe genome structure of MERS-CoV (30,119 nt) is similar to that of other coronaviruses.'
 'The fact that respiratory diseases rarely result from a single entity makes the rapid identification of novel causative agents complicated; however, in the case of MERS-CoV infection, confusion persisted until September 2012, when the virus in a Saudi patient was identified as a previously unknown coronavirus [77] .Bats have been found to be the reservoir hosts of dozens of viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs), henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, filoviruses, adenoviruses, picornaviruses and herpesviruses [1, 7, 12, 27, 36, 38, 40, 41, 62, 70] .'
 'Of course, the presence of unknown amplifying hosts is a distinct possibility, and there is an urgent need for widespread seroprevalence and virological screening for MERS-CoV in different fauna present in the Arabian Peninsula in order to discover the amplifying host(s).MERS-CoV has failed to replicate in Syrian hamsters following intratracheal inoculation and inoculation via aerosol [21] , and the best-known current experimental model for MERS-CoV infection is the rhesus macaque [22, 47] .'
 'The severity of the disease observed in humans may be explained by the ability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the lower respiratory tract [22] .'
 'The high prevalence of camels that are seropositive for MERS-CoV, or a closely related virus, and the isolation of MERS-CoV from camels are suggestive of a possible amplifying host, and therefore, further studies to monitor virus infections in camels are highly recommended in order to assess their potential role in MERS-CoV virus transmission.'
 'The transmission of the MERS-CoV to humans in general needs further study to clarify the role of the amplifying host and whether the virus is transmitted from bats to camels and then to humans, or whether other amplifying hosts are involved.'
 'An important question that requires large and comprehensive serological surveillance is whether MERS-CoV was introduced to and circulated in the general population in the countries of the Middle East, or possibly other countries worldwide, prior to the first reported cases.']

['The capacity to establish a correlation between the different types of viral agents and their clinical manifestations has been possible only through techniques that allow identification of a particular virus.There have been major advances in the last decade in this respect, and new techniques have emerged that have greater sensitivity to detect a viral causal agent within a wider viral spectrum that we can identify.Today, the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections is changing with the identification of new agents that help us to better understand this large group of "viral infections.'
 'The lowest sensitivity is related to adenovirus and is independent of the age of the patient.'
 'They have the advantage of providing results within 2 hours, but their sensitivity to detect viruses is still lower than that of immunofluorescence, and their performance depends on the age of the patient and on the type of respiratory virus.'
 'As it can be seen in the table, the molecular technique has better performance than DIF, and this is consistent with the results of other laboratory studies.'
 'Another important aspect that can be appreciated in the table is the performance and sensitivity of the methods in different age groups.'
 'This virus has been described as the most prevalent one in pediatric populations and as the second most frequent cause of hospitalization of children under 2 years of age with wheezing.Another important comparative advantage of PCR over DIF is the possibility of diagnosing viral coinfections in the same patient with greater sensitivity.'
 'Achievement of a rapid and certain diagnosis with good sensitivity is fundamental in these patients to determine the most appropriate therapeutic strategies, particularly for viruses that require specific therapy, such as influenza.Diagnosis of bacterial infections of the respiratory system has also made advances in recent years with the incorporation of techniques to reach rapid and precise diagnoses.'
 'Now a new method has been introduced that has been used for many years in research laboratoriesnamely, proteomic or mass spectrometry, in which bacterial protein profiles are identified by their distinct characteristics, on the basis of which the genus and species can be determined rapidly.This microbiological technique has been developed for a system called MALDI-TOF (matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight) mass spectrometry, which basically consists of four stages: recovery of a colony under study previously isolated from the culture, running of the mass spectrometry, comparison with databases, and presentation of the results.']

['2006) , thus requiring adaptive evolution of the immune system to conquer these bat pathogens.Gene conversion and gene duplication are the main forces that drive the evolution of the mammalian type I IFN gene family (Hughes 1995; Woelk et al.'
 'Especially for the IFNA genes, gene conversion has become the main evolutionary force after the divergence of birds and mammals but before the divergence of the ancestors of eutherian species (Shaw et al.'
 'Thus, our results also suggest that consideration of gene conversion is necessary for evaluation of selective pressure among the gene family.Duplication is the main force leading to the evolution of gene families (Ohno et al.'
 'Our results revealed that positive selection had favored the bat INFA genes with the detection of positively selected sites among bat IFNA genes, and gene conversion could contribute to a change of selective force.'
 'Of all type I IFNs, IFNA has the largest number of subtypes (Shaw et al.'
 'We have also successfully cloned the multiple genotypes of bat IFNA, and our evolutionary analysis suggested that evolution of the bat IFNA family has been favored by positive selection.'
 "The cloned pseudogene revealed that the evolutionary loss of function also shaped the bat genome during IFNA evolution.Pathogens have evolved various ways to avoid the antiviral effects of the host's immune system."
 'The positive selection noted in bat IFNA genes probably reflects the conflict between bat pathogens and the interferon-mediated immune system, as the pathogens evolve blocks to recognition by the immune system and the immune system tries to maintain recognition.']

['Even though serological antibody detection techniques meet this temporal definition, they have not been included given that demonstrating seroconversion (appearance of antibodies in the serum) or seroreinforcement (increase in the initial titre of antibodies by a factor of 4) may take weeks or months to come about, with high levels of variability between individuals.Given the simplicity and swiftness of their implementation and with which results can be obtained and interpreted, some of these RDTs may also be used as "point-of care tests" (POCT) with the subsequent benefits for the patient, who may receive the diagnosis and, depending on the result, the treatment in one single consultation.In general, the use of RDTs in the diagnosis of RIs can help to:• Reduce the use of antibiotics, given that many RIs are of a viral aetiology.'
 '• Ensure the use of suitable anti-viral therapy in specific cases.• Minimise the use of unnecessary diagnostic tests.• Reduce the length of hospital stays.• Permit the swift implementation of isolation measures to limit nosocomial infection, whenever necessary.Moreover, in RIs of bacterial origin, on detecting the antigen of the target pathogen or its nucleic acids, RDTs are affected to a much lesser extent than culture in the diagnosis in the event that antibiotic treatment has already commenced.The RDTs for group A Streptococcus (GAS) are fundamentally aimed at determining the bacterial nature of the pharyngitis.'
 'This explains why RDTs for the diagnosis of this minor illness are among the most regularly used and are under continual assessment, since they help to prevent the inappropriate use of antibiotics.The gold-standard test for the diagnosis of GAS-induced pharyngitis continues to be bacterial culture in blood agar, either direct, after enrichment, or with selected plates incubated for between 24 and 48 h.RDTs for the detection of the GAS antigen in pharyngeal swabs appeared at the beginning of the 1980s.'
 'All of this, along with the simplicity and sound diagnostic performance of RDTs for the ICT antigen, has meant that there are currently very few clinical laboratories routinely using molecular techniques such as RDTs for GAS-induced pharyngitis.For invasive infections caused by GAS, the performance of RDTs has also been compared to culture, with the sensitivity of ICT antigen detection tests being similar to PCR and greater than culture.'
 'Unlike Legionella, the presence of S. pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in a respiratory sample is not always indicative of infection, since it is also a known coloniser of the upper respiratory tract, which complicates the interpretation of its diagnosis.The detection of the pneumococcus antigen in urine is one of the available RDTs.'
 'ribavirin against RSV and AD and pleconaril for HRV) have shown certain activity, their use has not been sufficiently established.As a consequence of acute RIs, every year, coinciding with the seasonal epidemics of influenza and RSV, there are excessive demands on the healthcare system, resulting in an increased number of visits and the overloading of the A&E Department, increased consumption of antibiotics and an increase in the performance of analytical and imaging tests.Based on samples from the respiratory tract (basically nasopharyngeal aspirate or lavage, and to a lesser extent samples taken with nasal and/or pharyngeal brushing in the viral transport medium), there are currently a number of procedures available to us which can help in the rapid aetiological diagnosis of the principal acute viral RIs.The different techniques can basically be split into two groups: antigen detection tests and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT).Direct and indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and ICTs are the most commonly used of these tests.'
 'The need for a centrifuge to make the extensions, setting and staining them correctly, the need to use a fluorescence microscope to view them, subjectivity in the interpretation of the result (skill of the observer), high dependence on the sample quality (presence of sufficient epithelial cells) and time required to obtain results (between 90 and 120 min) means that this technique is being used increasingly sparingly in the initial diagnosis of a viral RI in the majority of clinical laboratories.The use of classical IF techniques can be improved and facilitated by automating the process and performing a rapid objective reading of the reaction.'
 "They are less sensitive than IF, and unlike the latter, which allows a wide range of RVs to be detected, the majority of existing ICT devices have been designed to detect RSV and/or influenza A and B.With ICT, a great deal of variability is observed in the results, depending on the manufacturer, the sample used (much better sensitivity results are observed with nasopharyngeal aspirate/lavage than with samples taken with a brush), the time of the disease's evolution when the sample is taken (better in the first 24 h) and above all, the population in which it is applied (much worse results in the adult population than in children)."]

['1981 ) , which is derived by selective transfer from the circulating pool, rather than by local synthesis in the mammary gland as in monogastric animals like the horse (Lascelles, 1977) , Rotavirus vaccination has not been assessed in mares.The purpose of this work was three-fold--to establish the normal titres of anti-rotavirus antibody in mare milk and mare and foal serum throughout the first 10 weeks post-partum: to examine the response of the foal to infection: and to examine the response to intramuscular vaccination of the mare.'
 'After 1 hour at 37:C the plates were washed and either rat monoclonal antibody against mouse IgG* or avidin**, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase added for 1 hour at 37°C.In an extension of these assays used to examine further the nature of the response in the foals, parallel assays were performed using either rhesus rotavirus or UK rotavirus as the target antigen, and dilutions of foal sera taken post inoculation used to block a biotinylated, cross-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 57-8 ( Mackow et al., 1988 ) .The mean OD4,~_, of each dilution step was used to plot a curve for each sample and the result expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution calculated to give an OD4,~e of 50% that of the mean of the negative control wells.'
 "Two of the three mares showed a serum and a milk response following infection of their foals although the serological response was less marked than that of the foals ( Figs•  3 and 4) .The mares' response to vaccination was much more dramatic than their response to the infection they acquired from their foals."
 "In contrast, the response as determined using a serotype 6 target is more similar to that seen in the heterotypic, serotype 2 assay, although a slight peak at day 10 is evident.This study reports the first recorded observations of antibody titres in mares' milk to a specific antigen throughout lactation."
 'Expericnce with experimental infection of 2-day old, specific pathogen-free li)als (Browning et al., unpublished data) suggest that the primary humoral immune response can be detected at 6 days post inoculation in animals known to be naive.The earlier peak of serum anti-rotavirus IgA, in comparison to that of IgG has been observed in human adults ( Bernstein et al, 1989 ) , although the peak responses occurred somewhat earlier than was observed in the foals.'
 'Additionally, the assay seems sufficiently specific and sensitive to investigate the epidemiology of subclinical rotavirus infections, both in terms of incidence and prevalent serotypes.The mares also showed a serum response following infection of their foals but the response was much less marked, and there was little difference between the kinetics of the homotypic and heterotypic responses.'
 'However the inclusion of an adjuvant (in our study mineral oil) in the vaccine prevented any decline in the milk antibody response up to 10 weeks after vaccination.It should be noted that the vaccine strain used was a serotype 6 bovine rotavirus, but was able to stimulate antibody to serotype 3, the dominant equine rotavirus serotype (Browning et al., unpublished data) as well as to serotype 2 which has not been found in horses.'
 'It is also important to ensure that the lactogenic response induced by vaccination is not dependent upon recent enteric exposure to rotavirus as occurred with the mares in this study.The difference in the kinetics of the serotype 2 and 3 responses in apparently naive foals suggests that although there is a slight heterotypic response, it is fundamentally different from the homotypic response.']

['All clinical samples of 2014 which tested positive in the standard EV assay and subsequently typed as EV-D68, were also tested positive in the EV-D68 specific PCR.'
 '2) .In this paper, we presented 16 cases of respiratory EV-D68 infections in the Northern part of the Netherlands in 2014.'
 'All of these five adults required hospital care for respiratory infections.This upsurge of respiratory infections caused by EV-D68 was similar to what was seen in our hospital in 2009 and 2010 [2] .'
 'Also in the USA, only the children admitted to the hospital were tested and reported.'
 'We expect that the number in North America could be higher if the adult population with severe respiratory illness were included.The incidence of EV-D68 observed in our hospital, which is located in the least densely populated part of the Netherlands, is contrasted by the low number of reported EV-D68 infections in rest of the Netherlands, while no data are known about the current situation in Europe [4, 5] .'
 'Similarly, in the current 2014 study, we possibly witnessed in-hospital transmission of EV-D68 from one severely ill child to two children who developed mild respiratory symptoms.The low number of reported EV-D68 infections in Europe may be caused by the overall low circulation of EV-D68.'
 'The EV-D68 specific assay we describe in this paper, may be used for this purpose.All 16 cases described in this paper were diagnosed as EV-D68 infections by following routine protocols of our laboratory, in which respiratory samples are tested for enterovirus along with 14 other respiratory targets, and all enterovirus isolates are routinely sequenced.'
 'Our sequencing data, compared to the USA sequence data, suggest that similar strains are circulating in the USA and Europe.In conclusion, by following a routine protocol of screening respiratory samples for enterovirus and sequencing, we not only identified EV-D68 as the cause of 16 respiratory infections in our hospital, but we also were able to show a potential link with the ongoing EV-D68 in North-America.']
