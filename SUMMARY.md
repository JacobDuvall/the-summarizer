['Infectious or inflammatory mediators in the middle ear or in the labyrinth can cause sensorineural hearing loss.Children with AOM usually have fluid present in the mastoid air cells because of the direct connection with the middle ear ( Fig.'
 'Chronic mastoiditis almost always is associated with chronic suppurative OM, a chronic (≥2 months) drainage from the middle ear and the mastoid through either a perforation of the TM or a tympanostomy tube.The most common suppurative intracranial complication of OM and mastoiditis is bacterial meningitis, although its incidence has decreased dramatically since the advent of antibiotic therapy for acute infections and routine immunization against Haemophilus influenzae type B.'
 'Abnormal growth of squamous epithelium into the middle ear as a result of destruction of the margin of the TM may lead to formation of a secondary cholesteatoma.The most common ear mass in children is a cholesteatoma, a histologically benign lesion in the middle ear, mastoid space, or petrous bone containing keratinizing squamous epithelium.'
 'In the case of aural atresia, occult lesions can develop in the remnant of the external auditory canal or in the middle ear cleft.In the verbal child, the diagnosis of AOM is usually straightforward, with the patient complaining of ear pain (otalgia), fever, and an antecedent upper respiratory infection.'
 'The highly compliant cartilaginous walls of the external canal of infants younger than 6 months old can expand when air pressure is increased in the canal in this age group and result in a falsely normal reading.All examinations of the middle ear should include a determination of the mobility of the TM via pneumatic otoscopy.'
 'Children who have persistent retroauricular pain and a history of recurrent OM may not have other signs of an acute infection but may have clinically significant disease.The diagnosis of acute and chronic mastoiditis is confirmed by computed tomography of the temporal bone.'
 "Other indications for consultation include a history of recurrent or chronic OM, especially if the condition is bilateral, and a concern that the child's hearing, speech, or language development is abnormal.The presence of otorrhea or blood in the external canal suggests the possibility of an acute perforation of the TM or chronic suppurative OM with or without cholesteatoma."
 'Cases of OE that are persistent or recurrent warrant a culture of the ear discharge and the assistance of a specialist to evaluate the child for cholesteatoma or another undiagnosed condition.Traumatic perforations of the TM should be managed in consultation with an otolaryngologist.']

['With now more than a billion people in isolation worldwide, and with an exponentially growing proportion of universities closing their gates, it is legitimate to ask ourselves what is our place as scholars and researchers in the field of cyberpsychology -and if and whether our work is actually needed at this moment.The answer to this question is simple: yes, our work is greatly neededtoday more than ever.'
 'While technology (notably with the democratization of travelling) might have been one of the factors that made COVID-19 reach a pandemic status, technology -and particularly online technologies -will also be a key element for us to survive this crisis.'
 'As researchers specializing in how technology impacts human behavior, it is our duty to stay active, and to work to help document all these aspects.'
 'It is our duty to help propose and find solutions to the problems elicited by this sanitary crisis.We are however not blind.'
 'Many of us are facing massive and immediate switch of their teaching activities to distance modalities.'
 'We will do our best to accommodate reviewers as well, and bear in mind the situations we are all facing.'
 'Not all of us are first-line health professionals, putting their life in line while fighting this invisible enemy.Yet, all of the readers of this journal are likely to be experts in one or other avatars of cyberpsychology.'
 'Sharing this theoretical or practical expertise we have to help our colleagues, our students, our organisations, or our governments is something we can all do to get past this crisis.']

['We identified a strong seeding pattern from the tropics to all three climate zones, supporting the effectiveness of our methodology.We applied this model to the H3N2 and H1N1 coding regions of HA and NA, the most antigenic proteins of the eight viral segments.'
 'However, similar H1N1 analysis by continent and country was not possible due to the absence of a larger number of countries in the dataset.Applying the same methodology to the H3N2 HA1 domain increased the geographic diversity enough to enable reconstruction of the global influenza network prior to the 2009 pandemic strain at a country level.'
 'Despite the sparse number of countries for analysis, both HA ( Figure S3C ) and NA ( Figure 3C ) consistently identified Hong Kong (considered a country by NCBI sequence annotation) as the primary external seeder of USA and New Zealand among others, and New Zealand as the primary external seeder of Australia.Due to fewer available sequences, clustering H1N1 did not yield as many significant seeding events as H3N2; however, our tests suggest that H1N1 adopts a similar seeding pattern with the tropics as a source.'
 'To increase the amount of data from different geographical regions, we clustered H3N2 sequences of the HA1 epitope, expanding the number of isolates in the dataset from 2,251 to 4,864, and the number of countries from 17 to 81.'
 'To quantify observed patterns, we employed principles of graph theory to measure the importance of nodes using four different metrics.By counting the number of indegrees and outdegrees of each node for H3N2, we identified that the tropics and the northern temperate zone ( Figure S4A ), specifically Asia and North America ( Figure Figure  S5A ), transmit and receive the most seeding events to and from the rest of the world, respectively.'
 'Our novel method employs two main strategies to eliminate geographic and seasonal bias: 1) Spatiotemporal clustering of sequence data to count seeding events between clusters and 2) Use of binomial prior probabilities based on the regional proportion of viral isolates to screen for significant seeding events.Applying these techniques to coding HA and NA segments of H3N2 by climate zone and continent revealed a seeding pattern stemming from the tropics, particularly Asia.'
 'From there, China and Hong Kong seed two major subnetworks, each dominated by Australia and USA.Similar clustering of H1N1 NA sequences by climate zone reproduced tropical transmission to the rest of the world.'
 'Alternatively, global patterns may be weaker for H1N1 due to crossreactivity between the two strains [18, 19] , a conclusion reflected by the smaller number of seeding events for the strain.In our analysis, the total number of seeding seasons for each region did not necessarily correspond to the total number of isolates from each region, indicating that our methodology counters data bias.']

["Half (51%) of the respondents were aware of the Saudi MoH advice for 'at risk' individuals to postpone Hajj that year; however, none of these 'at risk' individuals adhered to this recommendation (Table 2) .Participants were acceptable with using preventive measures during Hajj for protection from MERS-CoV infection: 79% were willing to wash hands frequently, 73% planned to avoid contact with sick people showing symptoms of a respiratory infection, 65% were willing to use facemasks, and another 65% planned to avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth.Most departing pilgrims (62%) were aware of a mod-erate to high infection risk from raw camel milk consumption, yet 21% of participants were willing to drink it."
 'Nevertheless, among those who were aware of MERS-CoV, 27% did not fully realize the risk of catching the disease from unpasteurized camel milk, 15% were willing to drink raw camel milk, and 23% were keen to visit camel farm in Saudi Arabia (Table 3) .'
 'Compared to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 about which 90% Australian Hajj pilgrims were aware (Alqahtani et al., 2015b) , fewer pilgrims were aware of MERS-CoV.'
 'For instance, Ebola has affected over 28,640 people with a relatively higher fatality rate (40%) compared to fewer MERS-CoV cases (about 1,621) and a slightly lower fatality rate (36%) (WHO, 2015) .In this study, 62% of departing pilgrims were aware of the risk of contracting the disease from drinking raw camel milk while 21% were willing to drink camel milk if offered at Hajj.'
 "who showed that only 14% French pilgrims knew about the disease risk from drinking raw camel milk but 40% of them were willing to drink camel milk if offered during Hajj (Gautret et al., 2013a) , indicating that pilgrims' awareness influenced their attitude."
 'A unique finding to emerge from our study was that departing pilgrims with knowledge about MERS-CoV were significantly more aware of the risk of drinking raw camel milk (43% vs. 23%, P < 0.01), yet a considerable proportions of them were willingness to drink raw milk and visit camel farms (respectively 15% and 23%).'
 'Therefore, pilgrims who consume raw milk or other products are at risk of other zoonotic diseases if not MERS-CoV, and therefore, could benefit from appropriate health education.The current MERS-CoV guidelines by Saudi MoH stated that any person with close contact with camels (in the last 14 days), including drinking unpasteurized camel milk and showing respiratory symptoms, is suspected with MERS-CoV (CCC, 2015) .'
 'Given that 7% people reported having close contact with camels, we suggest development of a public health strategy to better communicate the risk to pilgrims and information about when to seek medical help should symptoms arise upon return.Over half of the departing pilgrims were aware of the Saudi MoH advice to postpone Hajj; nevertheless, none of the high-risk pilgrims decided to cancel their trip.']

['We recently introduced the concept of the infectome as a means of studying all infections throughout life which contribute to the development/progression of disease [1] , as it is now viewed that the majority of diseases develop as a result of the interaction between genetic and environmental influences [2] [3] [4] .'
 "It should also be noted that some common mechanisms may underlie the development of all or most autoimmune diseases, with subsequent exposures differentiating one disease from the other [27] .The concept of an ''exposome'' is being used as a means of collating and measuring the effects of environmental factors, both internal and external."
 "This review will emphasise the role of the ''infectome'' as the infectious component of the microbiome/exposome which contributes to the development of autoimmune disease."
 "As the infectome could broadly describe the infectious components of the exposome responsible for the induction of non-autoimmune in addition to autoimmune diseases, we may need to differentiate the ''autoinfectome'' from that not related to autoimmunity."
 "The concept of ''infectome'' that we introduce describes the part of the exposome which refers to the collection of an individual's exposures to infectious agents participating in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease (''auto-infectome'')."
 'Reactivity to several viral peptides was found, which has led to the speculation that continual exposure to a variety of viruses can lead to T cell expansion reactive against highly conserved proteins, including self-peptides [147] .In addition to providing answers to the aetiology of autoimmune disease, it is also envisioned that the infectome may also identify the cause of certain disease characteristics, such as variable presentation and progression, disease flares, or relapse-remittance.Primary biliary cirrhosis can also be used as a model disease to investigate the role of the infectome [148] .'
 'This type of regular follow-up and sample collection with analysis would occur throughout the disease, paying close attention to the findings at times of change in clinical course, such as the development of symptoms.It should be kept in mind that several patterns of infection may be seen in individuals with a particular disease characteristic or with a particular concomitant autoimmune disease.'
 'The complex nature of the exposome may require that it be broken down to several sub-components, such as the infectome, which reflects the characterisation and measurement of all infectious organisms that we are exposed to, and which contribute to the development and progression of disease.']

['(a) ADP-ribosylated PARP10 was treated with buffer (reaction i) or MacroD2 (reaction ii) and subjected to a second round of modification in the presence of [ 32 P]-NAD + followed by a treatment with buffer (reaction iii) or MacroD2 (reaction iv).'
 'The reactions were separated on polyacrylamide gels and subjected to autoradiography.'
 'Radioactive PARP10 signal was quantified and normalized to the pre-modified PARP10 treated with MacroD2 signal (reaction ii).'
 'Demodification reactions with [ 32 P]-ADP-ribosylated PARP10 were carried out by varying the studied parameter, followed by separation on polyacrylamide gels and quantifying the residual [ 32 P]-PARP10 signal on autoradiographs.'
 'The assay was carried out as in Supplementary Figure 9 Jankevicius et al.Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on MacroD2 in complex with an ADPr-Glu ester model were performed using the Amber11 package 1 .'
 'The ADPr-Glu ester was parameterized using the Antechamber module of Amber11 and the ester ligand was docked into the ligand binding site by superposition of the ADPr part on the crystal structure of ADPr in complex with MacroD2.'
 'For autoradiograph quantification, the AIDA 4.0 software package was used.In vitro activity modulation was checked by performing PARP1 de-modification reactions for a total of 15 minutes (see above), with the exception that 0.5 µM MacroD2 or MacroH2A.1.1 were present during the reaction.'
 'For testing GST-tagged macrodomain protein activities, the [ 32 P]-NAD + after PARP10 automodification reaction was not washed off but immediately followed by demodification reactions containing 0.5 µM GST-macrodomain for 15 minutes at 37 °C.To generate ADP-ribosylated peptide on lysine residue, 160 µM peptide (PAPAKSAPAPKKGSKK-Biotin) was incubated with 1 mM ADP-ribose derived from NAD and [ 32 P]-NAD hydrolysis in 25 mM Tris pH 8.3 at 37 °C for >7 days 6 .']

['The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of R. felis infection among febrile and afebrile children in rural and urban areas of Gabon and the possible role of R. felis in acute febrile illness.Gabon is a central African country located on the equator along the Atlantic Coast ( Figure 1) .'
 'In this study, we used molecular tools (PCR assays) to assess the prevalence of R. felis in blood specimens from febrile and afebrile children from rural, semiurban, and urban areas of Gabon.'
 'Furthermore, it has been reported that the prevalence of R. felis is low in northern Africa countries (France, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia) and increases in southern Africa countries (Mali, Senegal, Gabon) (14) .Consistent with our previous findings from Franceville in Haut-Ogooué Province (14) , our findings from this study confirmed the presence of R. felis bacteremia in febrile children in Gabon and showed that the prevalence of infection was higher in rural than urban and semiurban areas.'
 'However, its prevalence changes according to the season, year, area (rural, urban, and semiurban), country, and age of those infected.A comparison of our findings with previously reported data showed that R. felis prevalence among febrile children in Franceville decreased from 10% in 2012 (14) to 1.3% in 2014.'
 'In addition, the variation in the R. felis prevalence between urban (1.3%) and rural (39.7%) areas of Gabon showed that R. felis is unequally distributed in the country.'
 'Therefore, the presence of R. felis in febrile and afebrile persons should not exclude that this bacterium is a cause of fever in sub-Saharan Africa.In 2010, independent research teams detected R. felis in blood specimens from febrile patients in 2 different areas of Africa (eastern and western) (3, 4) .'
 'In other studies, these teams confirmed and extended the preliminary data: 1 team showed that the presence of R. felis was 2.2 times higher in blood specimens from febrile persons compared with afebrile persons in Kenya (5) , and the other team showed that the prevalence of R. felis was significantly higher in febrile (15.0%) than afebrile (4.0%) persons in Senegal (14) .'
 'Another hypothesis would be that blood specimens may be contaminated by surface bacteria, including R. felis, which has been detected on the skin of healthy persons in Senegal (38) .In summary, the R. felis bacterium is widespread in Gabon, but it primarily occurs in rural areas and is most prominent during the rainy season.']

['Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients in whom the pathogen was not identified, (2) patients in whom BAL fluid analysis was impossible (due to severe neutropenia or clotting of specimen) or not performed, (3) patients with a mixed infection (identification of bacteria and virus), (4) patients who were treated with antimicrobial agents for more than 24 hours before bronchoscopic BAL, (5) patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, (6) patients with mycobacterial infection, and (7) patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.Pneumonia was defined as the presence of an acute infiltrate on a chest radiograph and at least one of the following: fever (temperature $38.0uC) or hypothermia (temperature ,35.0uC), cough, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and altered breath sounds on auscultation [15] .'
 'Viruses were detected in both in BAL fluid and nasopharyngeal samples in 8 patients.Cellular BAL fluid profiles and distributions of BAL fluid cell counts in the two groups are shown in Table 3 and Figure 2 .'
 'The median serum procalcitonin concentration was also higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group (1.9 ng/ml vs. 0.3 ng/ml, P = 0.02), and the C-reactive protein concentration tended to be higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group (20.3 mg/dL vs. 14.9 mg/dL, P = 0.09).Of the 100 pathogen-identified patients who had received antimicrobial agent for more than 24 hours prior to bronchoscopic BAL (Figure 1) , 44 had bacterial pneumonia, 54 had viral pneumonia, and 2 had invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.'
 'Figure S1 shows the changes recorded in the BAL fluid total WBC count and percentage of neutrophils according to the duration of exposure to antimicrobial agents.Diagnostic performances of BAL fluid cellular components, serum procalcitonin concentration, and serum C-reactive protein concentration for the prediction of bacterial pneumoniaThe ability of BAL fluid cellular analysis to distinguish between bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia was assessed using ROC analysis (Table 3 last The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, positive likelihood ratios, and negative likelihood ratios are summarized in Table 4 .'
 'This study analyzed the usefulness of cellular analysis of BAL fluid for predicting the etiology of pneumonia in critically ill adult patients.'
 'The degree of pleocytosis, which was higher in the bacterial pneumonia, was useful for differential diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia.'
 'The data suggest that cellular analysis of BAL fluid is a rapid and useful technique for differentiating bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia, and can be used to direct early appropriate treatment.Information about the role of cellular profiles of BAL fluid for differential diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia in adult patients is limited.'
 '[13] investigated the usefulness of BAL in assessing pneumonia in renal transplant patients, and suggested that the optimal cutoff value of the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid is .20% for predicting bacterial pneumonia.']

['In contrast, the appearance of these diseases in NHPs, especially atherosclerosis, is increased with age and with the consumption of a Western diet, similar to what has been described in humans (Nadon 2006; Shively and Clarkson 2009 ).'
 'Therefore, it will be of interest to see whether diminished RIG-I or AIM2 expression in humans may contribute to enhanced susceptibility to these pathogens in the elderly.In humans, aging of the immune system is also associated with an increase in the systemic inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 and TNFα (De Martinis et al.'
 '2010 ).Age-related changes in innate and adaptive immunity lead to reduced immune response to infection and vaccination in humans, which in turn contribute to increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases (Weinberger et al.'
 '1999) .The initiation of CR during early adulthood (adult-onset CR, AO-CR, 5-7 years) resulted in higher frequencies of naive T cells, a more diverse T cell repertoire, increased T cell proliferative capacity, and reduced the frequency of memory T cells that secreted the pro-inflammatory factors IFNγ and TNFα in response to CD3 stimulation in both male and female rhesus macaques (Messaoudi et al.'
 'The discrepancies between the two data sets could be due to differences in the age of the animals at CR onset and the duration of CR.In contrast to AO-CR, juvenile-onset CR (JO-CR) in male rhesus macaques resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of terminally differentiated memory CD4 and CD8 T cells and the reduction of T cell repertoire diversity.'
 'The administration of recombinant rhesus IL-7 to young rhesus macaques leads to proliferation of naive and central memory CD4 and CD8 T cells (Picker et al.'
 'Moreover, treatment of SIV-infected young rhesus macaques with IL-7 increased absolute numbers of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as T cell activation and proliferation, which is likely due to an increase in thymic function (Nugeyre et al.'
 'Since male rhesus macaques also experience an age-related decline in circulating testosterone and DHEA levels as well as a marked attenuation of their circadian plasma profiles (Urbanski and Sorwell 2012) , they provide a robust and pragmatic animal model in which to investigate the interplay between androgen supplementation and immune senescence.Another intervention aimed at rejuvenating the thymus is the administration of human keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), which stimulates production and differentiation of epithelial cells in a variety of tissues, including the thymus (Alpdogan et al.']

['Infection of other glial cells and neurons has also been examined and will comprise a separate report .Astrocytes were the most numerous cell type (50-80% of the cells observed) in the dissociated canine brain cell cultures derived as described in the Materials and methods section .'
 'Despite the formation of syncytia in the virulent virus-infected cultures, the density of the astrocyte populations remained equal to that observed in the control cultures up to 63 days p .i .The percentage of astrocytes that expressed CDV antigen increased with time after inoculation in a pattern that varied with the virus strain [ Fig .'
 '6a ) a rapid rise in the percentage of infected astrocytes was observed and 100% of astrocytes were infected by 49 days p .i .'
 'We investigated whether the rapid rise in astrocyte infection, which was observed in the CDV A75-17 infected cultures beyond 35 days p .i ., represented a change in the virus population .'
 'The rapid and cytolytic infection of astrocytes in vitro produced by a vaccinal strain of CDV (the Onderstepoort strain) has been described, 10 but comparative studies of the rate of astrocyte infection by virulent and attenuated CDV strains has not previously been reported .Both CDV-SH and CDV A75-17 produce a non-cytolytic infection of astrocytes in How the astrocytes are able to survive for many weeks in culture while persistently infected with the virulent CDV strains is intriguing .'
 'Zurbriggen and co-workers" have also noted a rearrangement in the pattern of GFAP staining in CDV infected astrocytes, describing a concentration of fibrils in the perinuclear area and a loss of fibril staining in the rest of the cell body .The differences in the kinetics of astrocyte infection between the two virulent strains of CDV appears to parallel the course of CNS infection which is seen in dogs .'
 'Zurbriggen and co-workers" have suggested that toxic factors, released by astrocytes, may result in oligodendrocyte degeneration and thus demyelination .Our observed differences between the kinetics of the two virulent CDV infections in astrocytes in vitro could suggest a mechanism by which the CNS disease varies in the dog .'
 'A distinct neural cell tropism in vitro has been shown in the mouse corona virus system where the neurotropic JHM strain infected rate oligodendrocytes while the viscerotropic MHV-3 strain was able to infect rat astrocytes but not oligodendrocytes in culture .The permissiveness of astrocytes to infection by different strains of CDV may play a role in CDV pathogenesis in vivo .']

['It can be easily expressed as the ratio of the copy number of a target gene to the copy number of a single copy reference gene (two copies per cell) in a DNA sample, which is always 1 per haploid genome.'
 'By using two assays for the two genes (the gene of interest and the reference gene) with two fluorescent dyes on the same digital array, we are able to simultaneously quantitate both genes in the same DNA sample.'
 'The ratio of the numbers of molecules of these two genes is the relative copy number of the gene of interest in a DNA sample.'
 'It provides a reliable and robust platform to study copy number variations and has great advantages over conventional techniques.The sequence of the RPP30 synthetic construct and the sequences of the primers and probe used to amplify this construct are shown in Supplementary The TaqMan assay for the RNase P gene (VIC) was ordered from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).The feasibility of digital PCR has previously been demonstrated by performing PCR on a single DNA sample obtained by a serial dilution process (16, 17) .'
 'Since the newly generated molecules of both genes reflect the original ratio and they are not linked any more, a digital chip analysis can quantitate the molecules of the two genes and measure their ratio, and therefore the copy number of the gene of interest, very accurately ( Figure 3 ).'
 'It is very important that the amplification efficiencies of the two pairs of primers be approximately equal in order not to introduce any bias in the ratio of the two gene copy numbers in the limited number of STA thermal cycles, although this is likely to have an insignificant effect on our results since we utilized only five cycles of preamplification.'
 'However, since the copy number of the target gene is derived from the Ct difference between the target gene and a reference gene, the results are very sensitive to the efficiency of the amplification reaction.'
 'Although the clinical data (other than pathological classification) of these samples were lacking, about 35% of the samples had an increased number of this gene above 5, very close to the ERBB2 amplification frequency reported in the literature (67) .In conclusion, this study shows that the digital array provides a new and robust technology to study geneand sequence-specific CNV and is able to detect gene copy numbers with great accuracy.']

['The chimeric G protein was expressed by induction with 1 mM IPTG at 37 • C and analyzed on SDS-PAGE.The transgenic plant lines were screened for the expression of G protein by ELISA.'
 'The mice were bled on the 26th and 35th day, from the retroorbital sinus for the estimation of anti-rabies antibody titre in serum.The cell-free extract removed from E. coli cultures induced by IPTG for the expression of G protein was solubilized in 1 M urea and dialyzed against binding buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5 and 0.5 M NaCl.'
 'The relative level of the G protein transcript in the leaves of transgenic plants is estimated quantitatively from the number of cycles required for amplification as compared to that for ubiquitin taken as the internal control.'
 'The chimeric G protein expressed in tobacco leaves as well as the surface protein of rabies virus were higher in molecular mass (∼66 kDa) than (∼60.6 kDa) the protein expressed in E. coli.'
 'Such high level of expression was not obtained in the only earlier study (McGarvey et al., 1995) reported on intact G protein expression in plant leaves.The G protein expressed in the tobacco leaves and E. coli was analysed further for glycosylation by examining its ability to bind the concanavalin A matrix.'
 'The results establish that the rabies virus glycoprotein expressed in tobacco leaves is glycosylated and is not degraded during the purification procedure.The results of the mice experiments (Fig.'
 'In our study, the signal peptide of the native G protein was replaced by the tobacco PR-S signal peptide (Sijmon et al., 1990) , known to be efficient in transport of proteins in to the endoplasmic reticulum of the cells.'
 'This is understandably due to integration of the transgene at different positions in the genome of independentally selected transgenic lines (Peach and Velten, 1991) .The G protein expressed in tobacco leaves was stable and showed a higher apparent molecular mass (∼66 kDa) as compared to that in E. coli.']

['Despite controversy over the names and identity of certain isolates, this new and unique human pathogen was clearly not only a distant genetic relative of the known HTLV virus but may have been recently introduced to humans from a primate reservoir (Essex and Kanki, 1988) .After HIV-1 was recognized as the cause of AIDS, it was also recognized that this virus was new, at least to inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere.'
 'However, early clinical studies did not indicate differences in the pathogenicity of the virus-host interactions in Africa compared with the United States or Europe.HIV-1 or a related virus was likely present in human populations in Central Africa at the same time or even before AIDS was diagnosed in the United States.In the early 1980s, Africans residing in Europe were presenting with similar clinical signs and symptoms of AIDS (Clumeck et al., 1983) .'
 'In prospective studies conducted to date, Africans infected with HIV-1 appear to develop clinical AIDS and other signs and symptoms of HIV disease as rapidly as individuals in the United States or Europe (Mann et al., 1986; Marlink et al., 1994) .'
 'These findings appear to have been confirmed by more detailed genetic analysis of a virus from a chimpanzee housed in the United States, although the exact history and pedigree of this animal is unclear (Gao et al., 1999) .Because a relative of HIV-1 -SIV -had been found in wild African monkeys and was only about 50 per cent related to HIV-1 at the genomic level, it seemed logical that viruses more highly related to SIV might also be present in human populations.'
 'The MACS study population is largely a white homosexual male cohort, and it may not be possible to generalize all of these findings to other population groups with different modes of transmission and different viral subtypes.Sabin and colleagues have reported a similar predictive value of plasma viral loads in the large European hemophilia cohorts where their results confirm the importance of the HIV RNA level in assessing the long-term prognosis in individuals infected with HIV (Sabin et al., 1998) .'
 'In multivariate analysis, both early viral load and later changes were significant predictors of progression to AIDS (Hubert et al., 2000) .In recent years, through the study of primary HIV infection, we have learned that some degree of virus containment occurs in the very early phases of HIV infection in vivo.'
 'Subsequent to these early events and tied to the resolution of the acute clinical syndrome is the lowering of HIV load and rebound of CD4ϩ T lymphocyte levels.Corey and colleagues have reported considerable variability in the viral burden during these early phases of HIV infection, after 120 days after acquisition, followed by a rapid decrease in plasma HIV RNA levels to an inflection point, after which they gradually increase (Schacker et al., 1998) .'
 'There is no doubt that such new techniques will expedite our characterization of the ever-changing HIV epidemic and assist researchers in predicting the viral genotype that is relevant for targeting.The genetic diversity of the virus at the level of the infected individual is now appreciated as a quasi-species rather than a single genotype that continues to challenge the immune system and clearly plays a role in the pathogenicity of the virus.']

["Denoting the serum concentration by x 1 (t) and its rate of change by x 2 (t),Acceleration of the cytokine concentration is represented byIn vector-matrix form, the differential equation is expressed as.or, with the (261) state vector, x(t), and (262) stability matrix, A, in the general form,The initial concentration, x 1 (0) = 0, is referenced to the cytokine's basal level, and the initial rate of change, x 2 (0), is stimulated by the TGN1412 infusion."
 "The effects of clinical treatment are subsumed in the values of a and b.The cytokine's response modes are characterized by the eigenvalues, l 1 and l 2 (rad/day), of A, which are the roots of the characteristic equation,Consequently, eq."
 'The concentration of IL12 is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the other cytokines.The models allow us to predict responses to unit initialconditions in concentration and rate of change.'

 'Comparing the results to Table 1 , IL4 and IL6 are seen to be the least impacted by inter-cytokine coupling.Principal components assess the similarity of wave shapes in each of the nine cytokine histories.'
 '1-4) .Initial uncertainties in IL 6 and IL10 are the slowest to decay, while those in IL12 and IFN-c are the fastest.To assess the effects of continued random forcing of the cytokines by elements other than TGN1412 (e.g., unspecified immunological response), we add an (18618) disturbance covariance, W, to eq.'
 'The system model provides evidence for the regulation of cytokines by other cytokines, identifying inductive and inhibitive relationships among the nine cytokines as well as similarities in temporal histories.The present analysis illustrates that reducing the dosage rate of TGN1412 while increasing the duration of infusion (i.e., for fixed total dosage), would have little effect on peak cytokine concentrations until the infusion duration exceeded one day.']

 '2C , G4-T increases virus yield in TCID 50 by 16, 32, 13, 208, 13, 10, 62, and 58 folds, as compared with cells infected in a controlled manner with EV-A71, AIV, CDV, clinically new isolated NDV, PEDV, IBV, VSV, and HSV-1, respectively.To examine if G4-T promotes proliferation of viruses by abrogating the expression of type I IFN, we measure the mRNA levels of IFN-b, PKR, and ISG56.'
 'Based on the above results, we can conclude that G4-T treatment is associated with a more efficient replication of HCV.To quantify the effect of G4-T treatment on the efficiency with which virus infection induces syncytium formation, cells are infected with a recombinant NDV expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and cultured for 24, 48, and 60 h. The syncytiums number is then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.'
 'These results indicate that G4-T protein enhances the spreading and replication of GFP-NDV in a time-dependent manner.Our previous study showed that GLTSCR2 knockdown results in a reduced production of viral particles of VSV, NDV, and IBV by 60, 120, and 20 folds, respectively (Wang et al., 2016a) .'
 'Injection of chicken embryo with the GLTSCR2-specific shRNA-1370 at 24 h prior to infection with NDV decreases the virus titer in TCID 50 by 4, 3, 7, 6, 13, and 61 folds (Fig.'
 'Furthermore, shRNA targets NP of NDV that is delivered into the chicken embryos and reduces HA value by 10 folds in virus titer (Yue et al., 2009) , while siRNA targets NP of AIV and reduces HAU value by 8 folds (Ge et al., 2003) .In this study, GLTSCR2-specific shRNA-1370 is evaluated for antiviral activity against NDV and AIV by means of virus titration in chicken cells and embryos.'
 'At 96 h.p.i, the case with a shRNA-1370 treatment simultaneously or 24 h prior to infection with NDV substantially reduces the virus titer in TCID 50 by over 60 folds, and in HAU value by 3 folds for AIV.']

 'The 2 −ΔΔCT method [7] was used to calculate the expression values for all 84 genes and these values were used to evaluate these genes for differential expression between sick and asymptomatic animals.Multiple trait mixed model analyses were applied to hematological and cytokine (both ligand and receptor) transcript abundance.'

['The expression of IFN-from HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CD8 + T cells was enhanced in varying degrees by CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848To assess the cellular immune responses elicited by vaccination with HLA-A*0201 restricted SARS S peptides in combinations with CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848 respectively, HLA-A*0201/K b Tg mice were randomly divided into five groups to accept immunizations.'
 'Furthermore, the results provided evidence that CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848 which were potent activators of innate immune responses maybe differ in their ability to prime naïve CD8 + T cells or to induce memory CD8 + T cells.We have detected the production of IFN-␥ in total lymphocytes by ELISA.'
 'These results were consistent with the data from ELISA and further confirmed the effects of CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848 as adjuvants in improving the cellular immune responses.In our previous studies, we have shown that peptide-specific IFN-␥-producing cells induced by peptides19-23 belonged to CD8 + T cells but not CD4 + T cells.'
 'As shown above, the results from ELISA, ELISPOT and FACS, three different assays from distinct aspects, were coincident and demonstrated that CpG ODN which had significantly additive adjuvant effect could augment the cellular immune responses induced by HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides from SARS S protein.To further ascertain whether the distributions of HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CD8 + T cells were distinct in different organs, we detected the percentages of both IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ producing CD8 + T cells in lymph nodes, spleens and lungs.'
 'It indicated that peptides plus adjuvants could induce systemic cellular immune responses, suggesting that the CTLs elicited in vivo may have effective function in protecting body against infection.To characterize the phenotype of HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CD8 + T cells on the basis of their ability to produce IFN-␥, splenocytes from peptides alone and peptides plus CpG ODN immunized Tg mice were stimulated with cognate peptides.'
 'Taken together, the results provide evidence that longlasting peptide-specific memory CD8 + T cells can be induced by SARS S HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides plus CpG ODN and they have the ability to produce IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ in the same time.'
 'In addition, these results are consistent with the previous reports and show that majority of the long-time survival CD8 + T cells specific for SARS S HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides in vivo are effector memory cells.In the previous study, we evaluated the cellular immune responses of HLA-A*0201 Tg mice which were primed intramuscularly with SARS S DNA and boosted subcutaneously with HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides.'
 'Therefore, in the present study we evaluated the efficiency of synthetic CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848 as adjuvants in combination with CD8 + T cell epitope vaccine of SARS to immunize HLA-A*0201 Tg mice.CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848 as adjuvants are identified to be specific ligands for TLR which are potent activators of innate immune responses, activating dendritic cell (DC) maturation and inflammatory cytokine secretion, inducing an increase in the cross talk between the innate and adaptive immune systems, and thereby driving the expansion of CTLs that can destroy virus infected target cells.']

['Cytokine concentrations were Table 1 Diverse temperature profiles, IFN-g secretion by PBMC and antibody titres from piglets after take of intranasal PRV NIA-3 infection (group A) and failure of productive infection (groups B and C) Response after second i.m.'
 'This is consistent with the reported data from vaccination and challenge experiments as well as from survival of natural PRV field infections (Wittmann and Rziha, 1989; Kimman et al., 1994; Mettenleiter, 1996) .In the group of eight animals showing a heterogeneous course of temperature reaction, only two (group A: 21 and 22) reacted with a fever response showing a sharp rise in rectal temperature around day 4 post virus application (Fig.'

 'infection, the non-sensitized animals in group C needed 12 days for the formation of PRV specific serum antibodies after i.m.'
 'In contrast after PRV infection, in vitro PRV restimulation of PBMC from the same animals resulted in the release of high amounts of IFN-g in the culture supernatants exceeding by far those after ConA stimulation (Fig.'
 'It cannot be excluded that a glycoprotein per se or even certain epitopes might be sufficient for PBMC-mediated IFN production in re-stimulation experiments as already shown with porcine cells for corona virus type I IFN inducing capacity (Charley and Laude, 1988) and recently for herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D induced IFN-g production with murine CD4 + peripheral T-lymphocytes (BenMohamed et al., 2003) .The PBMC-mediated, PRV-specific IFN-g secretion was also tested after the fortuitous diverse course of body temperature reaction following intranasal virus application in a group of eight animals ( Table 1) .'
 'At that early time point after intranasal PRV application PBMC from the animals in groups B and C which had not reacted with a significant rise in body temperature failed to produce IFN-g in response to in vitro PRV restimulation (Table 1) .'

["Although work on the 'easy' vaccines has already been completed, it is hoped that a combination of conceptual and technical innovation will enable the development of more complex and sophisticated vaccines in the future.Although the eradication of smallpox in the 1970s and of poliomyelitis hopefully in the coming years mark two of the most important milestones in medical history, we now face an unprecedented succession of new pathogens which jump species barriers to infect humans, and the frustration deriving from the inability to control devastating diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis."
 'Among the reemerging diseases of the past few years, diphtheria and cholera should be mentioned [5] , as well as the frequent appearance of multidrug-resistant bacteria and the cases of anthrax infection as a result of deliberate release in 2001.In the case of influenza, concern for the advent of a new pandemic has been fuelled by reports of 89 human infections by the avian H5N1 virus strain (where H stands for hemagglutinin and N for neuraminidase, the two major surface glycoproteins of the virus) in 2004, leading to 52 deaths (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_ influenza/en/).'
 'This enabled the speedy development of diagnostic tools, as well as the identification and recombinant expression of targets for vaccines and therapeutic agents [10] [11] [12] .For the influenza virus, in addition to the annual definition of the relevant strains to be included in the vaccine for the following season, the World Health Organization closely monitors cases of avian flu (for further information, see the World Health Organization website indicated above), and prototype vaccines for these strains are being developed.'
 'Much research effort is also being invested into the development of improved cell culture systems that can replace completely the use of embryonated eggs in vaccine production and would render the production process more flexible and controllable.Several reports have addressed the question of how to stretch the available supply of vaccine doses in cases of shortage or in the face of a pandemic.'
 'Another vaccine approach is the use of heat shock proteins, which bind specifically and activate dendritic cells and, because they are loaded with endogenous peptides, can be purified from tumor cells and function as a combined antigen delivery system and adjuvant [40] .Because the main targets of adjuvants are DCs, it is a logical step to evaluate their direct use as a vaccine.Despite the labor-intensive necessity of individual cell culture for each patient, this approach can be attractive where other approaches have failed, for instance as a therapeutic vaccine in HIV or cancer patients.'
 'In spite of these setbacks, a very similar regimen has been shown also to be highly immunogenic against HBV, tuberculosis and HIV, and vaccination only with MVA expressing the mycobacterium A85 antigen elicited strong T cell responses [51 ] .Because the induction of T cells is considered to be crucial in anti-tumor immune responses, a huge number of trials are presently being conducted to test DNA vaccination regimens for anticancer treatment [52, 53] .'
 'In any case, for the development of therapeutic vaccines, it will be vital to understand how the balance can be tipped back from a state of tolerance to a successful immune response.The development of vaccines aimed at the polysaccharide (PS) capsule of bacteria is one of the great achievements in vaccinology.'
 'Here, the minimal requirements for an efficient vaccine are met in a single molecule: targeting to and activation of DCs, T cell help and activation of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells or B cells.The world of vaccines is undergoing dramatic changes.']

['The unabsorbed viruses were removed and then cells were inoculated with medium with or without EGTA for an additional 6 h or 12 h. The cells were collected to detect the genomic mRNA of PDCoV and the expression of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein.'
 'We also determined the viral titers by the plaque assay and the results showed that EGTA treatment decreased the PDCoV yield significantly at both 6 hpi and 12 hpi (Fig.'
 '6A) .To determine the effect of DTZ on PDCoV adsorption, IPI-2I cells cultured in 24-well plates were pretreated with DTZ (200 μM) and then inoculated with PDCoV (10, 20, 50 MOI) at 4°C for 2 h. After three washings, the cells were collected to determine the copies of the adsorbed viruses by real-time RT-PCR.'
 '6B , DTZ treatment did not significantly block virus attachment to IPI-2I cells at all tested infection doses (10, 20, 50 MOI).To further evaluate the effect of DTZ on PDCoV penetration, IPI-2I cells cultured in 24-well plates were inoculated with PDCoV (0.5, 1, 2 MOI) at 4°C for 2 h. The virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium containing DTZ (200 μM) and the temperature was shifted to 37°C to allow virus entry.'
 'Then, IPI-2I cells were transduced with recombinant lentivirus shCACNA1S for 72 h and infected with PDCoV (MOI = 0.5) for 12 h. As expected, knockdown of CACNA1S inhibited the expression of viral mRNA and the N protein and a reduction in viral titers was observed (Fig.'

['Furthermore, we developed a new type of adenovirus-based expression-display vector that not only encodes a transgene, but also presents it on the adenovirus capsid and conferred strong protection from FV challenge infection, correlating with augmented CD4 + T cell and anamnestic neutralizing antibody responses [19] .Using adenoviral vectors encoding F-MuLV Env and Gag proteins co-administered with vectors encoding murine type I IFN subtypes, we aimed to elucidate the effects of particular subtypes on vaccine-mediated protection in the FV model.'
 'To verify the results obtained in the FV model, we also performed immunizations of mice with adenoviral vectors expressing HIV Env and Gag-Pol proteins with co-administration of vectors encoding type I IFN subtypes.Enhanced FV immune protection after co-administration of adenoviral vectors expressing FV proteins and specific type I IFN subtypesWe generated E1-, E3-deleted Ad5-based vectors with wild-type or chimeric Ad5/35 fiber encoding murine type I IFN subtypes IFNα1, IFNα2, IFNα4, IFNα5, IFNα6, IFNα9 or IFNβ.'
 'While the immunization of mice with the reduced dose of F-MuLV Env-and Gag-encoding vectors alone did not result in significant protection against initial splenomegaly, coadministration of adenoviral vectors encoding IFNα2, IFNα4, IFNα6 or IFNα9, but not IFNα1, IFNα5 or IFNβ, resulted in significant reduction of FV-induced splenomegaly (P < 0.05; shown in Figure 1A and 1B for days 14 and 17 post-challenge (p.c.)).'
 'Here, no differences in the control of FV-induced disease were observed ( Figure 1D ).To determine whether co-administration of type I IFNs resulted in improved control over virus replication after FV challenge, viral loads in plasma of animals immunized with F-MuLV Env and Gag encoding vectors with or without co-administration of IFN subtype encoding vectors were analyzed at 10 days after FV infection ( Figure 2A ).'
 'No adjuvant effect on vaccine protection against FV was found for IFNα1 and IFNα5.IFNa2, 4, 6 and 9 co-expression enhanced vaccineinduced CD4 + T cell responsesTo elucidate the immunological mechanisms leading to improved protection after co-administration of specific type I IFN subtypes, we analyzed the virus-specific T cell response in mice vaccinated either with Env-and Gagencoding vectors alone or in combination with vectors encoding the four subtypes that improved protection (IFNα2, IFNα4, IFNα6 or IFNα9).'
 'Thus, the CD4 + T cell response in Env and Gag vaccinated mice, which was augmented by co-administration of IFNα4 ( Figure 3 ) was absolutely critical for vaccine protection.To analyze the kinetics of the improved CD4 + T cell response, we immunized mice once with Ad5.env+gag or Ad5.env+gag+IFNα4 and analyzed activation of CD4 + T cells in the draining lymph nodes at 3, 7 or 10 days after immunization.'
 'Cellular immune responses to an adenovirus-based HIV vaccine were improved by co-administration of select type I IFN subtypesTo determine whether the adjuvant effect of type I IFN subtypes also applied to vaccination against HIV, we analyzed immune responses to an HIV vaccine in mice using adenoviral vectors expressing HIV Env and Gag-Pol alone or in combination with vectors encoding IFNα2, IFNα4, IFNα6 or IFNα9.'
 'This is supported by the fact that we see a strong correlation of high control of FV-induced disease with the augmented CD4 + T cell response, whereas the levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies are not equally increased by co-administration of all analyzed IFNs, indicating a direct function of virusspecific CD4 + T cells.In the FV model, the only known CD8 + T cell epitope is located in the leader region of the Gag protein [21] , but after vaccination with adenoviral vectors encoding F-MuLV Gag, no immune response against this epitope was detected because the epitope peptide was obviously not processed.']

['The success of using siRNA to knockdown gene expression in vitro has led to a growing interest in applications of siRNA inhibitors in vivo for evaluation of the therapeutic potentials of the gene targets of interest, potency of siRNA inhibitors, the route of administration, and the unwanted adverse effects.'
 'Since the main goal of in vivo delivery is to have active siRNA oligos in the target cells, the stability of siRNA oligos in both the extracellular and intracellular environment after a systemic administration is the most challenging issue (Fig.'
 'Therefore, a delivery system capable of protecting siRNA oligos from the urinary excretion and RNase degradation, transporting siRNA oligos through the physical barriers to the target tissue, and enhancing cellular uptake of the siRNA, is the key to the success of in vivo siRNA application.The accessibility of different tissue types, the presence of various delivery routes, and a variety of pharmacological requirements makes it impossible to have a universal in vivo delivery system suitable to every scenario of siRNA delivery.'
 'Local delivery of siRNA to the front of the eye subconjunctivally or to the back of the eye intravitreously is highly efficient in silencing target gene expression, and therefore are effective administration routes for target validation for eye disease.'
 'In one study, siRNA introduced into hippocampus region by local electroporation led to a marked reduction in the expression of both the mRNA and protein of the target genes, such as GluR2 and Cox-1, without affecting the expression of other proteins [41] .The skeletal-muscle tissue is accessible for local siRNA administration.'
 'A local hydrodynamic approach, in which siRNA in a sufficient volume was rapidly injected into a distal vein of a limb that is transiently isolated by a tourniquet or blood pressure cuff, was tested for siRNA delivery in muscles of animal models and demonstrated a knockdown of both reporter and endogenous gene [44] .Intratumoral delivery of siRNA is a very attractive approach for functional validation of the tumorigenic genes.'
 'On the basis of the experience in the successful validation of a group of novel genes for their roles in tumorgenesis using intratumoral delivery of formulated siRNA [2, 4] , we believe that intratumoral delivery of siRNA into xenograft tumor models is a very useful platform for in vivo target validation.Some of the first published results showed activity of siRNA in mammals by delivering into mouse liver using the hydrodynamic delivery, a rapid injection of a large volume of aqueous solution into the mouse tail vein creating a high pressure in the vascular circulation that leads to an extensive delivery of siRNA into hepatocytes [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] .'
 'This ligand-directed nanoparticle delivery represents a novel and effective approach for a clinically viable systemic administration of siRNA oligos as the dual-targeted RNAi therapeutics.Currently, delivery of siRNA oligos as a therapeutic agent in vivo, through either local or systemic route, is evolving from the target validation tools to the proof of principle for potential RNAi therapeutics.']

['Depending on Social, cultural, and other diversity issues in the traumatic stress field 505 their cultural background and its traditions and beliefs, individuals may also have "multiple vulnerability status"-that is, to be members of more than one group or to have characteristic that cause them to be even more susceptible to discrimination or victimization (i.e., adolescent black male in the United States; a baby born with physical or developmental disabilities in a culture that endorses selective resources to the ablebodied; a gay man or lesbian woman of color in a highly homophobic and racist society).Age is yet another vulnerability factor dimension that has not received adequate recognition, with individuals at either end of the life span as most vulnerable.'
 "Like other forms of abuse, victimization of the elderly and less-abled is often based on the victim's relative degree of dependence and his powerlessness to defend himself.The extent and impact of exposure to traumatic stressors experienced by each of these vulnerable populations is discussed in this chapter, as are the efforts of international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide them with resources to reduce their exposure to traumatic stressors or to mitigate the adverse effects of traumatic exposure and PTSD (Box 11.1).Box 11.1 Key Points 1."
 'When investigating risk and protective factors for PTSD, it is essential therefore to consider race and ethnicity in the context not only of ethnocultural identity and group membership but also of racism and other sources of racial disparities in access to socioeconomic resources.Although all ethnoracial minority groups tend to be disproportionately disadvantaged with regard to the more privileged majority population, particularly severe disparities in access to vital resources often are complicated by exposure to pervasive (both intrafamilial and community) violence and by the loss of ties to family, home, and community.'
 'Religious beliefs and spirituality are other dimensions of culture that have not yet been given sufficient focus in most psychotherapy but must also be assessed and understood by the therapist (Walker, Courtois, & Aten, 2014) .Cultural competence means many things to many people, and unfortunately, it is often mistakenly equated with being of the same racial, ethnic, cultural, religious, or national background as the persons involved in a study or receiving services, or knowing in advance exactly what each person believes and expects, how they communicate with and are most receptive to learning from others, and what their experience has been in relation to sensitive matters such as psychological trauma or PTSD.'
 'The integration of culturally specific methods and rituals in prevention or treatment interventions for PTSD, however, requires careful ethnographic study (i.e., observing and learning about the values, norms, beliefs, and practices endorsed and enforced by different cultural subgroups and their particular idioms (ways of describing and explaining) traumatic stress and PTSD) so the PTSD clinician and researcher can truly work collaboratively withrather than imposing external assumptions and standards upon-the members of the wide range of ethnic and cultural communities.In most cultures, girls and women are subject to discrimination in the form of limitations on their access to crucial socioeconomic resources.'
 'The women in Making the Harm Visible recommend four ways to make the harm of sexual exploitation visible: listen to the experiences of survivors, expose the ideological constructions that hide the harm, expose the agents that profit from the sexual exploitation of women and children, and document harm and conduct research that reveals the harm and offers findings that can be used for policy initiatives.Reprinted with permission from the Introduction to Making the Harm Visible, Edited by D.

 'It is not surprising that the prevalence of PTSD is greater among persons with other than heterosexual sexual identities, and the extent to which this is the result of the pernicious stigma directed at such individuals in most cultures or of outright traumatic violence, or both, remains to be tested.Persons with physical or developmental disabilities are another group of persons who unfortunately may be subjected to stigma and discrimination.'
 'It is the psychological trauma that he experiences on this odyssey, and the chronic stressors and societal breakdown and oppression that led him-and millions of others of all ages and a multiplicity of ethnocultural groups-on this journey of crisis and survival, and not his ethnicity or cultural background that is responsible for the profound symptoms of PTSD that he develops.inflicted on Jewish people in Europe by the Nazis, the "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia and Serbo-Croatia in the 1980s, and the massacres and mass starvation and epidemics perpetrated in Rwanda in 1994, in Sudan beginning in 2003, and in Somalia, Kenya, and Zimbabwe most recently.']

['In the analysis of the genomes of the PEDV strains detected in the USA, most were grouped in the high mortality type similar to the Chinese PEDV strain (AH2012), and the remaining strains were grouped in the INDEL type, which have specific insertions and deletions in the S gene [9, 10] .'
 'When the difference between strains having the motif was less than 10% of the number of SNPs in the motif, the strain was determined to have the motif.'
 'Starting and ending sites for each motif were identified with reference to the whole genome sequence of the referential PEDV strain, Colorado/USA/2013.In order to explore the parental strain of the identified motifs, the nucleotide sequence within each motif of its reference strain was searched in GenBank by using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.'
 'The position of the detected motifs was identified in the reference genome of the USA PEDV strain, Colorado/USA/2013 (Fig 1) .'
 'Conversely, with respect to motifs M7 and M8, which were not found in Indiana12.83/USA/ 2013, nucleotides that were inconsistent with the nucleotides present in the reference strain (sparsely colored area) were found at the position of these motifs.Since the strain Indiana12.83/USA/2013 had six motifs (M1-M6), it was provisionally defined as the reference strain for the six motifs in the BLAST search.'
 'Considering the size of the motifs (34-2,032 nt) and the number of SNPs discontinuously included in each motif and identical to strains having the motif (smallest was 4 nt in motif M3), it is reasonable to suppose that the presence of these motifs was a result of an epidemiological connection between strains having the same motif and not the result of random genetic evolution in each distinct strain.'
 'This may suggest a possible epidemiological relationship between these strains although this was not obvious in the phylogenic tree analysis.The motifs M1-M6 were shared by the PEDV strains from two or more countries and the most frequently observed motif (M1) was found in the PEDV strains from all six countries included in this study.'
 'The inconsistency in the putative parent strains for each motif may suggest a complexity to the origin of these motifs found in the strain Indiana12.83/USA/2013.Since the presence of motifs are the result of expression of certain unique genome sequence (s) in a subgroup of PEDV strains, their presence may influence viral characteristics of host strains.']

['Thus, the long-term loss in memory might, in large part, be a consequence of the early lymphopenia and apoptotic loss in memory CD8 þ T cells.The failure to recover memory after the occurrence of virus-induced lymphopenia is probably due to the inability of CD8 þ T cells that are not specific to the virus to compete with the proliferation of T cells that are specific.'
 'Memory CD8 þ cells express higher levels of Bcl-2 and resist irradiation-induced apoptosis [25] , but when time is allowed for the repopulation of the irradiated environment, other cells proliferate more than the virus-specific memory cells and dilute that population proportionally [3 ] .'
 'Thus, a permanent loss of memory cells is observed under conditions of lymphopenia, even when there is not competition by the T cells responding to viral antigens during an acute infection.Preservation of memory after infections can occur if the memory cells cross-react with antigens that are encoded by the infecting virus [17 ] (Figure 1 ).'
 'T cells that are specific to the crossreactive epitope between LCMV and PV were deleted, just like those that are specific to other epitopes at the early stages of infection, and thereafter began to proliferate [20] .CD8 R T-cell apoptosis during silencing of the immune responseThe reduction of T-cell number from the spleen and lymph nodes as the immune responses silences at the end of infection is, in part, due to apoptosis [2] and, in part, due to dissemination of the T cells out of the lymphoid organs and into the peripheral tissue [27] .'
 'These tissue-dependent differences may reflect the fact that many cytokines and cell adhesion molecules can influence CD8 þ T-cell apoptosis and the expression of pro-apoptotic molecules [29 ,37,38] .So far, the focus has been on apoptosis and loss of CD8 þ T cells in the absence of available antigen to signal the TCR.'
 'As early as five days after acute LCMV infection, NP396-specific T cells had more profound increases in Dcm than GP33-specific T cells [28] , and higher proportions of NP396-specific than GP33-specific CD8 þ T cells bound Annexin V at day 7, 9, 12, 65, and 128 post-infection [29 ] , suggesting that the apoptotic properties of these antigen-specific T cells were forever altered by their initial antigenic exposure.Kinetic studies have also demonstrated differences in proliferation rates of various LCMV epitope-specific T cells, although not necessarily correlating with an apoptotic phenotype [44] ; this does, however, support the idea that T cells that are specific to different epitopes might behave in distinct ways.The clonal elimination under conditions of high antigen load during persistent infection has long been thought to be mediated by some form of AICD but has never been clarified because it occurred in mice defective in AICD functions.'
 'Important new kinetic studies, examining the frequencies of LCMV NP396-specific T cells by MHC-tetramers at different time periods after persistent infection, have indicated that the elimination of these T cells is substantially delayed, although not prevented, in FasL-or TNFR1-deficient mice, arguing for an AICD effect that might entail either of at least two pro-apoptotic mechanisms [43 ] (Figure 2 ).Persistent infections, therefore, cause a continual evolution of the function and numbers of T cells that are specific Progression of clonal exhaustion during persistent infection.'
 'NP396-specific T cells will also lose function, but depicted here is their propensity to be completely eliminated, presumably by apoptotic mechanisms, which are, in part, controlled by Fas/FasL and TNFa.for the infecting virus, but what is the impact of a persistent infection on memory T cells that are not specific to the persisting virus?']

['Child vaccination may also help to prevent transmission in the community in general.Development of candidate pandemic vaccines and extensive testing of protocols as part of pandemic preparedness measures meant that vaccines for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus could be rapidly developed following the emergence of the novel virus.Despite the preventive efficacy of vaccination, the need for treatment of severe influenza remains.Amantadine (or the related compound rimantadine) was, until recently, the only anti-influenza drug available.'
 'Further concern was also due to the fact that the neuraminidase inhibitors, and oseltamivir in particular, are the drugs of choice for clinical use against seasonal influenza and zoonotic H5N1 infections and were stockpiled by governments as a pandemic preparedness measure.The pandemic (H1N1) influenza virus that subsequently emerged in April 2009 was sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitor drugs and oseltamivir was widely used for treatment and prophylaxis.'
 'RSV infections in adults are probably under-recognized, and the severity of RSV infection in the elderly may be much underestimated as a cause of pneumonia.'
 'In RSV bronchitis and pneumonia, the peribronchiolar and interstitial infiltrate is characteristically lymphocytic.The severity of RSV infection is related to age.'
 'The clinical features of bronchiolitis are wheezing and hyperaeration, and these are characteristic of infants with RSV infection.In the USA, RSV is estimated to cause 4500 deaths per year in children under 2 years of age.'
 'Disease in the elderly may be particularly severe; up to 50% develop pneumonia.RSV infection is often diagnosed on the basis of the clinical features.'

 'The number of positively selected sites identified in X4 sub-populations was greater than in the R5 sub-populations, suggesting that gp120 gene of X4 variants was subject to a stronger positive selection pressure.'
 'An opposite pattern was observed in gp41 genes, where 27 and 17 positively selected sites were identified in R5 sub-populations of B and C subtypes, respectively, which was greater than the 24 and 11 sites in the X4 sub-population of B and C subtypes, respectively (Table  5 ).'
 'the number of positively selected sites on env genes between R5 and X4 sub-populations, the gp120 and gp41 genes underwent different evolutionary pathways in R5 and X4 variants.When taking subtypes into account, the number of positively selected sites in the env genes of subtype B was greater than in subtype C.

['Most of the cases have been documented on the Arabian Peninsula; however, sporadic cases have also been reported in Europe and Asia in travelers returning from the Middle East.'
 'Except in South Korea, the imported MERS-CoV has not established a substantive chain of infection beyond the index traveler case.'
 'The spread within South Korea to 186 people, resulting in 36 deaths, has been attributed to a delay in diagnosis and isolation of the index case, lapses in infection control, and care of patients by family members rather than trained medical staff.'
 'However, in a recent mBio article, Wang and colleagues report detailed genomic analysis of the virus implicated in the first known case of MERS in China (1).'
 'They describe 11 amino acid substitutions, 8 of them shared with the South Korean strain and MERS-CoV strains recently circulating in Saudi Arabia, and define a recombination event that they speculate may have contributed to enhanced human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV and the rapid spread of the virus in South Korea.Recombination is common in coronaviruses and has been implicated in the emergence of pathogenic coronaviruses in poultry, cats, and pigs (2, 3).'
 'clearly demonstrate through bootstrap scanning and single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses that the viruses found in South Korea and China represent a recombinant virus that contains a clade B group 3 coronavirus sequence in the 5= portion of the genome and a clade B group 5 coronavirus sequence in the 3= end of the genome, with a site of recombination between nucleotide positions 17206 and 17311, a region that spans the junction between the ORF1a and S genes.'
 'They note that the recombination is evident in recent strains identified in human cases of MERS in Saudi Arabia and estimate that the recombination occurred in Saudi Arabia in the later months of 2014.The paper is important in two respects.'
 'First, the recombination event may have resulted in the evolution of a new lineage of MERS-CoV with different transmission properties.']

['Evaluation of these fluids can aid in the diagnosis of FIP, but there is significant overlap in findings associated with FIP and those associated with other causes of effusion.'
 'In cats with the dry form of FIP, granulomas form in a variety of organs, making the dry form FIP even more difficult to diagnose.There is no good way to prevent FCoV infection at this time.'
 'Whereas animals with the dry form of FIP seem to mount an enhanced T-cell immune response against the virus.'
 'Abnormalities in complete blood counts in cats with FIP include anemia, lymphopenia, and/or an inflammatory leukogram with or without band neutrophils.The sensitivity and specificity of routine diagnostic test results for diagnosis of FIP are listed in Table 1 .'
 'Sensitivity and specificity are too low for any single routine diagnostic test to be definitive for the diagnosis of FIP.Theoretically, tests designed to detect FIPV or antibodies to FIPV should be more sensitive and/or specific.'
 'Often, this is not the case, because the genes, antigens, and antibodies associated with FIPV are also present in cats with FCoV.'
 'Sensitivity and specificity of these tests vary with the specific test used and the prevalence of FCoV in a population.'
 'Specificity ranges from 71 to 100% for this test.Although diagnostic tests for FIP lack the high sensitivity and specificity desired, judicious use of multiple tests can help support a diagnosis of FIP.']

['Hematological abnormalities reported for clinical cases include thrombocytopenia (36%), lymphopenia (34%), lymphocytosis (11%), and neutrophilia (8%) .While kidney failure necessitating renal replacement therapy has been reported for a number of MERS-CoV cases (Albarrak et al., 2012; Zaki et al., 2012; Drosten et al., 2013; Guberina et al., 2013; Guery et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013b; Omrani et al., 2013) , in the absence of postmortem examinations, there is no direct evidence of MERS-CoV replication in renal tissue.'

 'The dynamics of MERS-CoV shedding throughout the course of disease have not been well characterized, but high viral loads detected in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from infected patients suggests that coughing and exudates from the lower respiratory tract could be important mechanisms of MERS-CoV human-to-human transmission de Sousa et al., 2013) .The zoonotic source of MERS-CoV continues to play a role in outbreak epidemiology through repeated introductions of virus into the human population (Cotten et al., 2013a, b) .'
 'The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV, the region of the spike protein that attaches to the DPP4 receptor, has been mapped to 240 amino acid residues in the S1 region of the spike protein (Chen et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2013; Mou et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) .'
 'The RBD of the spike protein induces neutralizing antibodies, making it an important target for the development of prophylactics and therapeutics (Agnihothram et al., 2013; Du et al., 2013a, b, c; Gierer et al., 2013; Song et al., 2013) .Preliminary investigations of MERS-CoV host interactions and innate immune responses have been performed in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo in a nonhuman primate model.'

 'Creative approaches, such as the use of adjuvants that promote T H 1 cell responses, need to be pursued, and potential vaccines must be rigorously evaluated in animal models (Graham et al., 2013) .In the year since its identification, MERS-CoV has not only spread across the Arabic Peninsula, but has been transported to the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, and Spain (Bermingham et al., 2012; Buchholz et al., 2013; Gulland, 2013a, b; Health Protection Agency, 2013; Hijawi et al., 2013; Mailles et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013b; Puzelli et al., 2013) .'
 'Because zoonotic introductions continue to play a role in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in humans (Cotten et al., 2013b) , an elucidation of the mechanisms of zoonotic transmission is essential and intervention strategies should focus on controlling these events.Our clinical understanding of MERS-CoV infection is based on limited reports (Albarrak et al., 2012; Bermingham et al., 2012; Assiri et al., 2013a; Drosten et al., 2013; Guery et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013a; Omrani et al., 2013) .']

['Moreover, it was not explored if this molecule is antiviral in primary human hepatocytes and in vivo.To address these limitations, we inoculated Huh7-Lunet/hCD81/G-Luc cells with a Jc1-F-Luc virus in the presence of the compound and subsequently washed away unbound virus and compound.'
 'A chimeric virus carrying J8 derived E2 in the backbone of Jc1 produced infectious virus and exhibited partial resistance to flunarizine indicating that determinants in both E1 and E2 influence susceptibility to this drug (Supporting Figure S5B ).'
 'Collectively, this indicates that flunarizine interferes with HCV entry by targeting viral E1-E2 protein function(s) of almost all GT2 subtypes tested and with a clear preference for GT2 over other viral genotypes.To corroborate that E1 and E2 are targeted by flunarizine, we passaged HCV in presence of flunarizine.'
 'After ten weeks we observed drug resistance as infection of Huh7-Lunet/ hCD81/G-Luc cells by virus populations cultured in the presence of the drug was poorly inhibited by flunarizine compared to viruses cultured in the presence of DMSO (Fig.'
 'These mutations render HCV more susceptible to neutralizing antibodies, suggesting a high barrier to viral resistance.To precisely define the mode of action of flunarizine, we conducted time-of-addition experiments including HCV entry inhibitors which arrest HCV infection at distinct stages of cell entry (Supporting Figure S6 ).'
 'These results indicate that flunarizine specifically targets HCV membrane fusion and that resistance is primarily mediated by two mutations within E1.To further corroborate that flunarizine targets HCV fusion, we utilized an imaging assay of fluorescent DiD-HCV entry into polarized, three dimensional hepatocyte cultures (Baktash et al., unpublished data), which enables quantification of HCV single particle cell surface trafficking to the tight junction complex, virus internalization into early endosomes and ultimately fusion and uncoating.'
 'Therefore, flunarizine does not affect HCV trafficking and endocytosis but inhibits fusion of HCV with the endosomal membrane.Flunarizine is a T-type Ca 2+ channel inhibitor and belongs to the group of diarylmethyl piperazine drugs.'
 'Therefore, we consider it unlikely that inhibition of Ca 2+ -channels by these drugs -which then would be used by HCV in a genotype-dependent fashion -is responsible for the anti-HCV activity of this class of molecules.Secondly, it is possible that flunarizine, pimozide and phenothiazines directly bind E1-E2, thereby inhibiting membrane fusion.']

['I believe that the child can be best treated when both parents are informed and agree to the treatment plan the dentist has presented.'
 "Anything less is ethical treatment of the child's teeth, not the child.Sometimes the ethical professional goes beyond the legal minimum and accepts the burden and the responsibility of educating the patient and the parents, not just for the present, but for the child's future as well.I often have met with parents who are married, and yet are not in an amicable relationship, and are unable to agree on the treatment of the child."

 'Absolutely not, but they result in an understanding about the health of the child by all parties involved.The situation described in the Ethical Moment was real for me as I began practice.'
